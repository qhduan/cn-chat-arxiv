    Technological Shocks and Algorithmic Decision Aids in Credence Goods Markets

    [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17929](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17929)

    该论文研究了在信任商品市场中，技术冲击和算法决策辅助如何帮助消费者获得更好的诊断和治疗，以提高市场效率和消费者福利。

    

    在信任商品市场（如医疗保健或维修服务）中，消费者依赖具有更多信息的专家来进行准确的诊断和治疗。然而，专家在诊断能力方面存在限制，这损害了市场效率和消费者福利。技术突破可以替代或补充专家判断能力，有潜力缓解消费者受虐待的情况。本文研究了当技能分布和消费者的信息不对称时，竞争性专家如何采用新型诊断技术。我们区分了增加专家能力的新技术和辅助判断的算法决策辅助工具，在不影响专家个人诊断精度的同时提供辅助判断。我们表明，高能力专家可能会因为与低能力专家差异化而放弃决策辅助工具，从而逃避汇集均衡。在线实验的结果支持我们的假设，显示了这一情况。

    In credence goods markets such as health care or repair services, consumers rely on experts with superior information to adequately diagnose and treat them. Experts, however, are constrained in their diagnostic abilities, which hurts market efficiency and consumer welfare. Technological breakthroughs that substitute or complement expert judgments have the potential to alleviate consumer mistreatment. This article studies how competitive experts adopt novel diagnostic technologies when skills are heterogeneously distributed and obfuscated to consumers. We differentiate between novel technologies that increase expert abilities, and algorithmic decision aids that complement expert judgments, but do not affect an expert's personal diagnostic precision. We show that high-ability experts may be incentivized to forego the decision aid in order to escape a pooling equilibrium by differentiating themselves from low-ability experts. Results from an online experiment support our hypothesis, showi
