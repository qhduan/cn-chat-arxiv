    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑解决具有连续纯策略集和对收益函数的一阶访问的两人零和博弈的混合纳什均衡计算问题。该问题在以博弈理论为灵感的机器学习应用中出现，如分布式稳健学习。在这些应用中，策略集是高维的，因此基于离散化的方法不能返回高精度的解。本文引入并分析了一种基于粒子的方法，该方法针对此问题具有保证的局部收敛性。该方法将混合策略参数化为原子测度，并对原子的权重和位置应用近端点更新。它可以被解释为“相互作用”Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao梯度流的时间隐式离散化。我们证明，在非退化的假设下，该方法从任何初始化以指数速度收敛于准确的混合纳什均衡，并提供数值实验来说明该方法的实际性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents and analyzes a particle-based method for computing the mixed Nash equilibrium of two-player zero-sum games with continuous sets of pure strategies and with first-order access to the payoff function. It achieves exponential convergence to the exact solution from any initialization, provided that certain non-degeneracy assumptions are met. Numerical experiments are also provided to demonstrate the method's practical performance."
