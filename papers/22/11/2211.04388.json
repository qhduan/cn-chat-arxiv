    "abstract": "We develop a quantitative general equilibrium model of multinational activity embedding corporate taxation and profit shifting. In addition to trade and investment frictions, our model shows that profit-shifting frictions shape the geography of multinational production. Key to our model is the distinction between the corporate tax elasticity of real activity and profit shifting. The quantification of our model requires estimates of shifted profits flows. We provide a new, model-consistent methodology to calibrate bilateral profit-shifting frictions based on accounting identities. We simulate various tax reforms aimed at curbing tax-dodging practices of multinationals and their impact on a range of outcomes, including tax revenues and production. Our results show that the effects of the international relocation of firms across countries are of comparable magnitude as the direct gains in taxable income.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们建立了一个嵌入企业税收和利润转移的定量一般均衡模型，研究了跨国经营。除了贸易和投资摩擦外，我们的模型表明利润转移摩擦形成了跨国生产的地理位置。我们模型的关键在于区分实际活动和利润转移的企业税收弹性。我们量化模型需要估算转移利润流量的。我们提供了一种新的、与模型一致的方法，根据会计恒等式来校准双边利润转移摩擦。我们模拟了各种旨在遏制跨国公司逃税行为的税收改革，以及它们对一系列结果的影响，包括税收收入和生产。我们的结果表明，公司国际转移对多个国家的影响与可纳税收入的直接增益相当。",
