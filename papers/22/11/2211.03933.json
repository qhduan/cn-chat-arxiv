    "translated_abstract": "网络入侵检测系统(NIDS)在检测恶意攻击时仍然面临挑战。NIDS通常在离线状态下开发，但面对自动生成的端口扫描渗透尝试时，会导致从对手适应到NIDS响应的显着时间滞后。为了解决这些问题，我们使用以Internet协议地址和目标端口为重点的超图来捕捉端口扫描攻击的演化模式。然后使用派生的基于超图的度量来训练一个集成机器学习(ML)的NIDS，从而允许在高精度、高准确率、高召回率性能下实时调整，监测和检测端口扫描活动、其他类型的攻击和敌对入侵。这个ML自适应的NIDS是通过以下几个部分的组合开发出来的：(1)入侵示例，(2)NIDS更新规则，(3)触发NIDS重新训练请求的攻击阈值选择，以及(4)在没有先前网络性质知识的情况下的生产环境。",
