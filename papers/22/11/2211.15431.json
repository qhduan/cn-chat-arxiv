    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们引入了一个具有随机动态的银行间网络，并考虑了网络内对未来违约的担忧所引起的内生困境传染。具体而言，这涉及到一种正向-反向方法来确定均衡动力学，通过市场价值调整来确保银行间债权的估值，并通过条件概率来确定当日的资产负债表。与静态模型不同，所得到的困境传染作为一项随机波动率项，内生地导致了波动率聚类和显著的下行杠杆效应。此外，通过考虑多个到期日，我们的模型为银行间债权提供了系统风险感知的期限结构。我们分为两个部分进行分析：(i) 单一到期日设置，与传统的银行间网络文献非常匹配，(ii) 多个到期日设置，以研究系统风险对整个期限结构的影响。",
