    "translated_abstract": "我们提出和统一了不同的图上信息传播模型。第一类模型将传播建模为一种波，它从一组已知节点在初始时间开始向所有其他未知节点传播，传播的顺序由信息波前的到达时间确定。第二类模型基于路径上的行程时间的概念。从一组初始已知节点到一个节点的信息传播时间被定义为所有可以到达该节点的路径的子集上的广义旅行时间的最小值。最后一个模型类是通过在每个未知节点上施加一个eikonal形式的局部方程，并在已知节点处施加边界条件来给出的。在一个节点的解的值与具有较低值的相邻节点的解的值耦合。我们提供了模型类的精确公式，并证明了它们之间的等价性。受到第一到达时间模型和eikonal方程之间的联系的启发，我们提出了一种新的混合形式，结合了波和eikonal模型。最后，我们在各种图形上展示了模型的数值模拟，包括随机图形、小世界图和实际网络。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes and unifies different models for information propagation over graphs, including three categories utilizing wave, path travel time, and eikonal equation respectively, and provides precise formulations and equivalences between them. A new mixed model combining wave and eikonal models is also proposed. Numerical simulations are conducted on various graphs, including random graphs, small-world graphs, and real-world networks."
