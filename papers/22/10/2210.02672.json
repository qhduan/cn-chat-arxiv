    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种解决正交非负矩阵分解（ONMF）问题的新方法，该问题的目标是通过两个非负矩阵（特征矩阵和混合矩阵）的乘积来近似输入数据矩阵，其中一个矩阵是正交的。我们展示了如何将ONMF解释为特定的设施定位问题，并针对ONMF问题采用基于最大熵原则的FLP解决方案进行了调整。所提出的方法保证了特征矩阵或混合矩阵的正交性和稀疏性，同时确保了两者的非负性。此外，我们的方法还开发了一个定量的“真实”潜在特征数量的特征-超参数用于ONMF。针对合成数据集以及标准的基因芯片数组数据集进行的评估表明，该方法在不影响近似质量的情况下具有较好的稀疏性、正交性和性能速度，相对于文献中类似方法有显著的改善。",
