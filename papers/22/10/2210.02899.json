    "translated_abstract": "近年来，通过机器学习技术处理无线电频谱数据以解决认知无线电网络相关问题，如异常检测、调制分类、技术分类和设备指纹等领域，取得了很大进展。大多数解决方案都是基于受控制的、带标签的数据，并使用监督式学习方法进行处理。然而，在现实世界环境下测量的频谱数据高度不确定，其标记是一项费时且昂贵的过程，需要领域专业知识，因此成为在该领域使用监督式学习方法的主要缺点之一。本文研究了在现实世界未标记数据中利用无人监督学习（SSL）来探索频谱活动的使用。具体来说，我们比较了两种 SSL 模型的性能，一种基于 DeepCluster 参考体系结构，另一种适用于频谱活动识别和聚类，以及一种新型的混合 SSL 方法，结合了两种模型。我们的实验评估表明，这三种方法都可以有效地对频谱活动数据进行聚类，混合方法的性能最佳。",
