    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了一种名为MBURST的新颖的多模态解决方案，用于音频-视觉语音增强，并考虑了有关前额叶皮层和其他脑区金字塔细胞的最新神经学发现。所谓的爆发传播通过反馈方式实现了几个准则，以更符合生物学的方式解决信任分配问题：通过反馈控制塑性的符号和幅度，通过不同的权重连接在各层之间多路复用反馈和前馈信息，近似反馈和前馈连接，并线性化反馈信号。MBURST利用这些功能学习噪声信号和视觉刺激之间的相关性，从而通过放大相关信息和抑制噪声赋予语音以含义。在Grid Corpus和基于CHiME3的数据集上进行的实验表明，MBURST能够复现类似的掩模重建，与多模态反向传播基准方法相比。",
