    "translated_abstract": "在边缘计算中，用户服务配置文件由于用户移动而进行迁移。已经提出了强化学习（RL）框架来进行迁移，通常是在模拟数据上进行训练。然而，现有的RL框架忽视了偶发的服务器故障，尽管罕见，但会影响到像自动驾驶和实时障碍检测等对延迟敏感的应用。因此，这些（罕见事件）故障虽然在历史训练数据中没有得到充分代表，却对基于数据驱动的RL算法构成挑战。由于在实际应用中调整故障频率进行训练是不切实际的，我们引入了FIRE，这是一个通过在边缘计算数字孪生环境中训练RL策略来适应罕见事件的框架。我们提出了ImRE，一种基于重要性抽样的Q-learning算法，它根据罕见事件对值函数的影响进行比例抽样。FIRE考虑了延迟、迁移、故障和备份pl",
