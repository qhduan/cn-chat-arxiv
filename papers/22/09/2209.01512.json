    "translated_abstract": "监测货币供应是进行健全货币政策的重要前提，但传统上货币指标的估计是以总体为单位进行的。本文提出了一种能够利用现实世界支付系统的微观级交易数据的新方法。我们应用一种新颖的计算技术来测量货币在个人账户中持有的持续时间，并通过其逆反计算货币的传输速度。我们的新定义在传统假设下退化为现有定义。然而，在总余额波动和消费模式发生改变的支付系统中，逆估计仍然适用。我们的方法应用于肯尼亚的一个小型数字社区货币Sarafu的研究中，从2020年1月25日到2021年6月15日可以获得交易数据。我们发现，Sarafu的传输速度比看起来的要高，因为并非所有的Sarafu单位都保持在活跃循环中。",
