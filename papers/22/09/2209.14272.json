    "translated_abstract": "幽默是人类情感和认知的重要元素。其自动理解可以促进更自然的人机交互和人工智能的人性化。目前的幽默检测方法仅基于策划数据，不能满足“现实世界”应用的需求。我们通过引入新颖的Passau-Spontaneous Football Coach Humour（Passau-SFCH）数据集，该数据集包含约11小时的录音，解决了这一缺陷。Passau-SFCH数据集的注释根据Martin的幽默风格问卷提出的幽默存在及其维度（情感和方向）。我们进行了一系列实验，采用预训练的Transformer、卷积神经网络和专家设计的特征。分析了自发幽默识别的每种模态（文本、音频、视频）的性能，并研究了它们之间的互补性。我们的研究结果表明，对于幽默及其情感的自动分析，多模态联合使用效果更好。",
