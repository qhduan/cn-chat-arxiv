    "translated_abstract": "最大均值差异（MMDs）如核Stein差异（KSD）已经成为广泛应用的中心，包括假设检验、采样器选择、分布近似和变分推断。在每个设置中，这些基于核的差异度量需要实现（i）将目标P与其他概率测度分离，甚至（ii）控制对P的弱收敛。在本文中，我们推导了确保（i）和（ii）的新的充分必要条件。对于可分的度量空间上的MMDs，我们描述了分离Bochner可嵌入测度的核，并引入简单的条件来分离所有具有无界核的测度和用有界核来控制收敛。我们利用这些结果在$\\mathbb{R}^d$上大大扩展了KSD分离和收敛控制的已知条件，并开发了首个能够精确度量对P的弱收敛的KSDs。在这个过程中，我们强调了我们的结果的影响。",
