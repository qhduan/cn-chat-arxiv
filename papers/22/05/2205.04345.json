    "abstract": "Current diagnostic tests for regression discontinuity (RD) design face a multiple testing problem. We find a massive over-rejection of the identifying restriction among empirical RD studies published in top-five economics journals. Each test achieves a nominal size of 5%; however, the median number of tests per study is 12. Consequently, more than one-third of studies reject at least one of these tests and their diagnostic procedures are invalid for justifying the identifying assumption. We offer a joint testing procedure to resolve the multiple testing problem. Our procedure is based on a new joint asymptotic normality of local linear estimates and local polynomial density estimates. In simulation studies, our joint testing procedures outperform the Bonferroni correction.",

    "translated_abstract": "目前回归不连续(RD)设计的诊断检验存在多重检验问题。我们发现，在五个顶级经济学期刊中发表的实证RD研究中，鉴别限制被大量过度拒绝。每个检验的名义大小为5％，但每个研究的中位数测试次数为12。因此，超过三分之一的研究中至少拒绝了其中一个检验，其诊断程序无法证明鉴别假设的正确性。我们提供了一种联合检验程序来解决多重检验问题。我们的程序基于新的局部线性估计和局部多项式密度估计联合渐近正态性。在模拟研究中，我们的联合检验程序胜过了Bonferroni校正。",
