    "abstract": "arXiv:2204.05798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Traditionally, deep learning methods for breast cancer classification perform a single-view analysis. However, radiologists simultaneously analyze all four views that compose a mammography exam, owing to the correlations contained in mammography views, which present crucial information for identifying tumors. In light of this, some studies have started to propose multi-view methods. Nevertheless, in such existing architectures, mammogram views are processed as independent images by separate convolutional branches, thus losing correlations among them. To overcome such limitations, in this paper, we propose a methodological approach for multi-view breast cancer classification based on parameterized hypercomplex neural networks. Thanks to hypercomplex algebra properties, our networks are able to model, and thus leverage, existing correlations between the different views that comprise a mammogram, thus mimicking the reading process",

    "translated_abstract": "传统上，用于乳腺癌分类的深度学习方法执行单视图分析。然而，由于乳腺X-ray图像中包含的相关性，放射科医生同时分析组成乳房X光摄影检查的所有四个视图，这为识别肿瘤提供了关键信息。鉴于此，一些研究已经开始提出多视图方法。然而，在这样的现有架构中，乳房X光图像被独立的卷积分支处理为独立的图像，从而失去了它们之间的相关性。为了克服这些局限性，在本文中，我们提出了一种基于参数化超复数神经网络的多视图乳腺癌分类方法。由于超复数代数特性，我们的网络能够建模并利用组成乳房X光检查的不同视图之间的现有相关性，从而模拟阅片过程。",
