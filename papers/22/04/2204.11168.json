    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在包含多个输入的大规模数据集上评估任意多元多项式的问题，使用一个主节点和多个工作节点的分布式计算系统。提出了广义拉格朗日编码计算（GLCC）代码，同时提供针对不及时返回计算结果的落后者的鲁棒性，针对恶意工人故意修改结果以获取好处的安全性，以及在工人可能共谋的情况下维护数据集的信息理论隐私。GLCC代码首先将数据集分成多个组，然后使用精心设计的插值多项式对数据集进行编码，并将多个编码数据点分享给每个工作器，使得可以在主节点上消除跨组的干扰计算结果。特别地，GLCC代码包括现有最先进的拉格朗日编码计算（LCC）代码作为一种特例，显示出更灵活的折衷方案。",
