    "translated_abstract": "独立性测试是一个经典的统计问题，在固定采集数据之前的批量设置中得到了广泛研究。然而，实践者们往往更喜欢能够根据问题的复杂性进行自适应的程序，而不是事先设定样本大小。理想情况下，这样的程序应该（a）在简单任务上尽早停止（在困难任务上稍后停止），因此更好地利用可用资源，以及（b）在收集新数据之后，持续监测数据并高效地整合统计证据，同时控制误报率。经典的批量测试不适用于流数据：在数据观察后进行有效推断需要对多重测试进行校正，这导致了低功率。遵循通过投注进行测试的原则，我们设计了顺序核独立性测试，克服了这些缺点。我们通过采用由核相关性测度（如Hilbert-）启发的投注来说明我们的广泛框架。",
