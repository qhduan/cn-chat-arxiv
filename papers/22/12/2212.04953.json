    "translated_abstract": "Basecalling是纳米孔测序分析中的重要步骤，它将纳米孔测序仪的原始信号转换为核酸序列，即reads。最先进的basecallers使用复杂的深度学习模型实现高度的basecalling准确性。这使得basecalling在计算上效率低下且内存消耗大，成为整个基因组分析流程的瓶颈。然而，对于许多应用来说，大多数reads与感兴趣的参考基因组不匹配（即目标参考基因组），因此会在后续的基因组流程步骤中被丢弃，浪费了basecalling的计算。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了TargetCall，这是第一个用于消除basecalling中浪费计算的预基调过滤器。TargetCall的关键思想是在basecalling之前丢弃不会与目标参考基因组匹配的reads（即非目标reads）。TargetCall由两个主要组件组成：（1）LightCall，一个轻量级的神经网络basecaller，产生噪声reads；",
