The standard approach for designing agents for such settings is to compute or approximate a relevant game-theoretic solution concept such as Nash equilibrium and then follow the prescribed strategy. However, such a strategy ignores any observations of opponents' play, which may indicate shortcomings that can be exploited. We present an approach for opponent modeling in multiplayer imperfect-information games where we collect observations of opponents' play through repeated interactions. We run experiments against a wide variety of real opponents and exact Nash equilibrium strategies in three-player Kuhn poker and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms all of the agents, including the exact Nash equilibrium strategies.",

    "translated_abstract": "在许多现实世界的情境中，代理商与多个对立代理商进行战略互动，对手可能采用各种策略。对于这样的情境，设计代理的标准方法是计算或逼近相关的博弈理论解，如纳什均衡，然后遵循规定的策略。然而，这样的策略忽略了对手玩游戏的任何观察，这些观察可能表明可以利用的缺点。我们提出了一种多人不完全信息博弈中的对手建模方法，通过重复交互收集对手玩游戏的观察。我们对三人 Kuhn 扑克展开了对许多真实对手和准确的纳什均衡策略的实验，结果表明我们的算法明显优于所有的代理商，包括准确的纳什均衡策略。",
