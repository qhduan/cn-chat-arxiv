    "translated_abstract": "组合多轮递增拍卖（Combinatorial Multi-Round Ascending Auction，CMRA）是一种新的拍卖格式，已经在几次最近的欧洲频谱拍卖中使用。我们对拍卖特定的真实出价、需求扩大和需求减少的后期均衡进行了表征，对拍卖者的边际价值为递减或非递减的情况进行了研究。特别地，我们发现真实告知的均衡对拍卖者的上限存在微小的不对称性是脆弱的。另一方面，如果拍卖者足够对称，CMRA容易受到无风险勾结的影响。我们提出了一种替代的活动规则，以防止这种勾结策略，但保持其他均衡不变。我们讨论了我们的理论在丹麦频谱拍卖中的一致性程度，以及如何利用竞标数据来测试我们的预测。",

    "en_tdlr": "The Combinatorial Multi-Round Ascending Auction (CMRA) is a new auction format that has been employed in European spectrum auctions. We analyze the equilibrium outcomes of this auction in terms of truthful bidding, demand expansion, and demand reduction. We find that truthful bidding is sensitive to slight asymmetries in bidders' caps, while the CMRA is susceptible to risk-free collusion if bidders are sufficiently symmetric. We propose an alternative activity rule to prevent collusion while maintaining other equilibria. The consistency of our theory with Danish spectrum auctions is discussed, as well as the possibility of testing our predictions using bidding data."
