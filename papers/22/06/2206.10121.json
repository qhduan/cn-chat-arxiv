    "translated_abstract": "设计高效准确的高维偏微分方程数值求解器仍然是计算科学和工程中一个具有挑战性和重要性的课题，主要是由于在设计能够按维数进行扩展的数值方案中存在“维度灾难”。本文介绍了一种新的方法，该方法在具有有限个解析表达式的函数空间中寻找近似的偏微分方程解，因此将该方法命名为有限表达方法（FEX）。在近似理论中证明了FEX可以避免维度灾难。作为概念证明，本文提出了一种深度强化学习方法，用于在不同维度上实现FEX求解各种高维偏微分方程，实现了高甚至机器精度，并具有多项式维度的记忆复杂度和可操作的时间复杂度。具有有限解析表达式的近似解还为地面真实偏微分方程解提供了可解释的洞察。",
