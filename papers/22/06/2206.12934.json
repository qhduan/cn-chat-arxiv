    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种名为 TPTND 的概率类型自然演算系统，该系统旨在推导有关概率计算过程的可信性属性，例如当今人工智能应用程序中的那些属性。TPTND 中的推导被解释为从给定的分类分布中提取 n 个可能复杂输出样本的过程。我们将这些输出样本的可信性形式化为一种假设测试，即计算出现有的频率与预期的概率之间的距离。这个演算系统的主要优势在于能够检查这种可信性的概念。我们为推理过程中出现的项提供了计算语义，并定义了逻辑运算符以及信任运算符的引入和消解规则。我们重点介绍了系统的结构和元理论属性，尤其是能够确定哪些项演化和逻辑规则应用时，计算仍然是可信的。",
