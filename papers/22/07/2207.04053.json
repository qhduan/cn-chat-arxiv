We provide arguments and examples, of why causality is particularly important for fairness evaluation. In particular, we point out the social impact of non-causal predictions and the legal anti-discrimination process that relies on causal claims. We conclude with a discussion about the challenges and limitations of applying causality in practical scenarios as well as possible solutions.",

    "translated_abstract": "除了在流行病学、政治和社会科学中的常见应用案例外，事实证明因果关系在评估自动决策的公正性方面十分重要，无论是在法律上还是日常生活中。我们提供了关于为何因果关系对公平性评估尤为重要的论点和示例。特别是，我们指出了非因果预测的社会影响以及依赖因果主张的法律反歧视过程。我们最后讨论了应用因果关系在实际场景中的挑战和局限性，以及可能的解决方案。",
