We use the ACT-R/{\\Phi} cognitive architecture and an existing knowledge graph system, ConceptNet, to consider this question not only from a cognitive and sociocultural perspective, but also from a physiological perspective. In addition to using a cognitive modeling as a means to explore how antiblackness may manifest in the design and development of AI systems (particularly from a software engineering perspective), we also introduce connections between antiblackness, the Human, and computational cognitive modeling. We argue that the typical eschewing of sociocultural processes and knowledge structures in cognitive architectures and cognitive modeling implicitly furthers a colorblind approach to cognitive modeling and hides sociocultural context that is always",

    "translated_abstract": "我们如何利用认知建模来考虑反黑和种族主义更广泛地影响AI系统的设计和开发？我们提供了一个讨论和一个示例来回答这个问题。我们使用ACT-R/{\\Phi}认知体系结构和现有的知识图系统ConceptNet，不仅从认知和社会文化的角度考虑这个问题，也从生理学的角度考虑。除了利用认知建模来探索反黑如何在AI系统的设计和开发中表现出来（尤其是从软件工程的角度），我们还介绍了反黑、人类和计算认知建模之间的联系。我们认为，在认知体系结构和认知建模中典型的回避社会文化过程和知识结构，隐含地推动了认知建模的色盲方法，并隐藏了总是存在于AI系统中的社会文化背景。",
