    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了匹配追踪的基本限制，即通过字典中的元素的稀疏线性组合来近似目标函数的纯贪婪算法。当目标函数包含在对应于字典的变化空间中时，许多令人印象深刻的研究在过去几十年中获得了匹配追踪的收敛速度的上界和下界，但它们并不匹配。本文的主要贡献是填补这一差距，并获得匹配追踪性能的精确描述。我们通过改进现有的下界以匹配最佳上界来实现这一目标。具体来说，我们构造了一个最坏情况的字典，证明了现有的上界不能改进。事实证明，与其他贪婪算法变体不同，收敛速度是次优的，并且由解某个非线性方程的解决方案决定。这使我们得出结论，任意程度的收缩都会改善匹配追踪效果。",
