    "translated_abstract": "在许多领域中，利用网络信息进行预测建模已经变得非常普遍。在推荐和定向营销领域中，影响者检测是一个可以通过动态网络表示大大受益的领域，原因是不断发展的客户-品牌关系。为了阐述这一思想，我们引入了INFLECT-DGNN，这是一个使用加权损失函数的图神经网络（GNN）和递归神经网络（RNN），针对图数据适应的合成少数过采样技术（SMOTE）以及精心设计的滚动窗口策略的新框架。为了评估预测性能，我们利用一个包含三个城市网络的独特企业数据集，并制定了一个以利润为驱动的影响者预测评估方法。我们的结果表明，使用RNN来编码时间属性以及GNN显著改善了预测性能。",
