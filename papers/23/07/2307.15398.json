    "abstract": "In this paper we present the initial screening order problem, a crucial step within candidate screening. It involves a human-like screener with an objective to find the first k suitable candidates rather than the best k suitable candidates in a candidate pool given an initial screening order. The initial screening order represents the way in which the human-like screener arranges the candidate pool prior to screening. The choice of initial screening order has considerable effects on the selected set of k candidates. We prove that under an unbalanced candidate pool (e.g., having more male than female candidates), the human-like screener can suffer from uneven efforts that hinder its decision-making over the protected, under-represented group relative to the non-protected, over-represented group. Other fairness results are proven under the human-like screener. This research is based on a collaboration with a large company to better understand its hiring process for potential automation. ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了初始筛选顺序问题，这是候选人筛选中的关键步骤。它涉及一个类似人类的筛选者，其目标是在给定初始筛选顺序的候选人池中找到前k个适合的候选人，而不是最好的k个适合的候选人。初始筛选顺序表示类人筛选者在筛选之前如何安排候选人池。初始筛选顺序的选择对所选的k个候选人有重要影响。我们证明，在候选人池不平衡的情况下（例如，男性候选人多于女性候选人），类人筛选者可能在决策过程中对受保护的、代表性不足的群体产生不平等的努力。其他公平性结果也在类人筛选者下得到证明。这项研究是与一家大公司合作的，旨在更好地了解其潜在自动化的招聘流程。",
