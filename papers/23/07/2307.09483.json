    "abstract": "Efficient and sustainable power generation is a crucial concern in the energy sector. In particular, thermal power plants grapple with accurately predicting steam mass flow, which is crucial for operational efficiency and cost reduction. In this study, we use a parallel hybrid neural network architecture that combines a parametrized quantum circuit and a conventional feed-forward neural network specifically designed for time-series prediction in industrial settings to enhance predictions of steam mass flow 15 minutes into the future. Our results show that the parallel hybrid model outperforms standalone classical and quantum models, achieving more than 5.7 and 4.9 times lower mean squared error (MSE) loss on the test set after training compared to pure classical and pure quantum networks, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model demonstrates smaller relative errors between the ground truth and the model predictions on the test set, up to 2 times better than the pure classical model.",

    "translated_abstract": "高效可持续的发电是能源领域的一个关键问题。尤其是热电厂在准确预测蒸汽质量流量方面面临困难，这对于运营效率和成本降低至关重要。在本研究中，我们使用一个并行混合神经网络结构，该结构将参数化量子电路和传统的前馈神经网络相结合，特别设计用于工业环境中的时间序列预测，以提高对未来15分钟内蒸汽质量流量的预测能力。我们的结果表明，并行混合模型优于独立的经典和量子模型，在训练后的测试集上相对于纯经典模型和纯量子网络，平均平方误差（MSE）损失分别降低了5.7倍和4.9倍。此外，该混合模型在测试集上表现出相对误差较小，比纯经典模型更好，最多提升了2倍。",
