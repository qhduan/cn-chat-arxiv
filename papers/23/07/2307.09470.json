    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一种新的马尔可夫游戏类别，即带有网络可分离交互的多人零和马尔可夫游戏（MZNMGs），以模拟非合作多智能体顺序决策中的局部交互结构。我们将MZNMG定义为一个模型，其中与每个状态相关的辅助游戏的收益是零和的，并且在某个交互网络上的邻居之间具有一些可分离（即聚合矩阵）结构。我们首先确定了马尔可夫游戏能够被表示为MZNMG的必要和充分条件，并且证明在这些游戏中，马尔可夫粗糙相关均衡（CCE）的集合缩减为马尔可夫纳什均衡（NE）的集合，即前者对所有玩家的每个状态的边际化乘积结果得到后者。此外，我们证明在无限时间折扣MZNMGs中找到近似马尔可夫\\emph{稳定}CCE是PPAD难题，除非底层网络具有``星状结构''。",
