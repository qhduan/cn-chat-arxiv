    "translated_abstract": "海藻生物量在气候减缓方面具有重要潜力，但需要大规模的自主开放式海洋农场来充分利用。这些农场通常具有低推进力，并受到海洋洋流的重大影响。我们希望设计一个控制器，通过利用非线性时变的海洋洋流来达到高生长区域，从而在几个月内最大化海藻生长。复杂的动力学和无效性使得即使知道洋流情况，这也是具有挑战性的。当只有短期不完善的预测且不确定性逐渐增大时，情况变得更加困难。我们提出了一种基于动态规划的方法，可以在已知真实洋流情况时有效地求解最优生长值函数。此外，我们还提出了三个扩展，即在现实中只知道预测的情况下：（1）我们方法得到的值函数可以作为反馈策略，以获得所有状态和时间的最佳生长控制，实现闭环控制的等价性。",
