Such questions can be answered by studying brain recordings like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As a first step, the neuroscience community has contributed several large cognitive neuroscience datasets related to passive reading/listening/viewing of concept words, narratives, pictures and movies. Encoding and decoding models using these datasets have also been proposed in the past two decades. These models serve as additional tools for basic research in cognitive science and neuroscience. Encoding models aim at generating fMRI brain representations given a stimulus automatically. They have several practical applications in evaluating and diagnosing neurological conditions and thus also help design therapies for brain damage.

    "translated_abstract": "大脑如何表示不同的信息模式？我们能否设计出一个可以自动理解用户思考内容的系统？这些问题可以通过研究功能磁共振成像（fMRI）等大脑记录来回答。作为第一步，神经科学界为被动阅读/听觉/观看概念词汇、叙述、图片和电影相关的认知神经科学数据集作出了贡献。过去二十年中，还提出了使用这些数据集的编码和解码模型。这些模型作为基础研究中的额外工具，在认知科学和神经科学领域有着多种实际应用。编码模型旨在自动地生成fMRI大脑表征，给定一个刺激。它们在评估和诊断神经系统疾病以及设计大脑损伤治疗方法方面有着多种实际应用。解码模型解决了根据fMRI重构刺激的逆问题。它们对于理解大脑如何处理信息以及设计脑机接口的发展都有着重要意义。",
