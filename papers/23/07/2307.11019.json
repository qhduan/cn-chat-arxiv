    "translated_abstract": "知识密集型任务（例如，开放域问答（QA））需要大量的事实知识，并经常依赖外部信息进行协助。最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）（例如，ChatGPT）在解决包括知识密集型任务在内的各种任务上展现出了惊人的能力。然而，目前尚不清楚LLMs在感知其事实知识边界方面表现如何，特别是在使用检索增强时的行为。在本研究中，我们对LLMs的事实知识边界进行了初步分析，并研究了检索增强对LLMs在开放域QA上的影响。具体而言，我们关注了三个主要研究问题，并通过检查LLMs的QA性能、先验判断和后验判断来进行分析。我们提供了证据表明LLMs对于自己回答问题的能力和回答的准确性充满了自信。",
