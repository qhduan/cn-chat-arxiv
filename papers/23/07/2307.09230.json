    "translated_abstract": "本文对使用机器学习和人工智能从语音记录中检测喉癌的当前文献进行了范围评估。我们找到了22篇相关论文，并讨论了它们的方法和结果。我们将这些论文分为两组 - 九篇进行二分类，13篇进行多类别分类。这些论文提出了一系列方法，其中最常见的是使用神经网络。在分类之前还从音频中提取了许多特征，其中最常见的是梅尔频率倒谱系数。在这次搜索中未找到任何带有代码库的论文，因此无法复现。因此，我们创建了一个公开可用的代码库来训练自己的分类器。我们在一个多类别问题上使用迁移学习，将三种病理和健康对照进行分类。使用这种技术，我们取得了53.54%的加权平均召回率、83.14%的敏感性和特异性。",
