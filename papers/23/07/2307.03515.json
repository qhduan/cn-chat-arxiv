    "translated_abstract": "垂直联邦学习（VFL）是一种有前景的方法，用于合作训练在不同参与方之间垂直划分的私有数据的机器学习模型。在VFL设置中，理想情况下，主动方（拥有带标签样本特征的参与方）通过与某些被动方（拥有相同样本但没有标签的额外特征的参与方）合作，在保护隐私的情况下改进其机器学习模型。然而，激励被动方参与VFL可能具有挑战性。本文重点研究了基于被动方在VFL过程中的贡献来为他们分配激励的问题。我们将这个问题定义为核心游戏论概念的一种变体——破产问题，并使用塔木德划分规则来解决它。我们在合成和真实数据集上评估了我们提出的方法，并展示它确保了激励的公平性和稳定性。",
