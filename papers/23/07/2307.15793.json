    "translated_abstract": "会议在工作协调中发挥着关键的基础设施作用。近年来，由于向混合和远程工作的转变，越来越多的会议正在转移到在线计算机媒体空间。这导致了新的问题（例如在更不吸引人的会议上花费更多的时间）和新的机会（例如自动转录/字幕和总结支持）。最近的大型语言模型（LLMs）在对话总结方面取得了进展，通过减少个人的会议负担和增加会议输出的清晰度和一致性，有可能提高会议体验。尽管存在这种潜力，但由于长篇转录和无法根据用户的上下文捕捉到多样的总结需求，它们面临着技术限制。为了填补这些差距，我们设计、实现并在上下文中评估了一种会议总结系统。我们首先构思了两个明显的总结表示方式——重要亮点和结构化的分级会议纪要视图。我们开发了一个系统来实现这些表示方法。",
