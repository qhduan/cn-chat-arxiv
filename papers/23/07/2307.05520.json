    "translated_abstract": "当前计算机视觉领域的研究主要集中在提高深度学习（DL）的正确性和推理时间性能上。然而，目前很少有关于训练DL模型带来巨大碳足迹的研究。本研究旨在分析模型架构和训练环境对训练更环保的计算机视觉模型的影响。我们将这个目标分为两个研究问题。首先，我们分析模型架构对实现更环保模型同时保持正确性在最佳水平的影响。其次，我们研究训练环境对生成更环保模型的影响。为了调查这些关系，我们在模型训练过程中收集了与能源效率和模型正确性相关的多个指标。然后，我们描述了模型架构在测量能源效率和模型正确性方面的权衡，以及它们与训练环境的关系。我们在一个实验平台上进行了这项研究。",
