In this work, we extend active specification learning by proposing a novel framework that strategically requests a combination of membership labels and pair-wise preferences, a popular alternative to membership labels. The combination of pair-wise preferences and membership labels allows for a more flexible approach to active specification learning, which previously relied on membership labels only. We instantiate our framework in two different domains, demonstrating the generality of our approach. Our results suggest that learning from both modalities allows us to robustly and conveniently identify specifications via membership and preferences.",

    "translated_abstract": "主动学习是一种研究广泛的学习形式规范的方法，例如自动机。在这项工作中，我们通过提出一种新颖的框架，将主动规范学习扩展到请求组合成员标签和成对偏好（对成员标签的一种流行替代方式）。成对偏好和成员标签的组合允许更灵活的主动规范学习方法，它先前仅依赖成员标签。我们将我们的框架应用于两个不同的领域，证明了我们方法的广泛性。我们的结果表明，从两种模式学习可以通过成员和偏好来稳健和方便地识别规范。",
