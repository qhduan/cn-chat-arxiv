    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了嵌套随机块模型（NSBM），用于对一组网络进行聚类，同时检测每个网络中的社群。NSBM具有几个吸引人的特点，包括能够处理具有潜在不同节点集的无标签网络，灵活地建模异质社群，以及自动选择网络类别和每个网络内社群数量的能力。通过贝叶斯模型实现这一目标，并将嵌套狄利克雷过程（NDP）作为先验，以联合建模网络间和网络内的聚类。网络数据引入的依赖性给NDP带来了非平凡的挑战，特别是在开发高效的采样器方面。对于后验推断，我们提出了几种马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗算法，包括标准的Gibbs采样器，简化Gibbs采样器和两种用于返回两个级别聚类结果的阻塞Gibbs采样器。",
