    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种受物理启发的方法，用于推断定向时态网络中的动态排序 - 每个定向且带时间戳的边反映了一对交互的结果和时间。每个节点的推断排序是实值且随时间变化的，每次新的边缘都会提高或降低节点的估计强度或声望，这在真实情景中经常观察到，包括游戏序列，锦标赛或动物等级的相互作用。我们的方法通过求解一组线性方程来工作，并且只需要调整一个参数。因此，对应的算法是可扩展且高效的。我们通过评估方法在各种应用中预测交互（边缘存在）及其结果（边缘方向）的能力来测试我们的方法，包括合成数据和真实数据。我们的分析显示，在许多情况下，我们的方法比现有的方法更好地预测了动态排序。",
