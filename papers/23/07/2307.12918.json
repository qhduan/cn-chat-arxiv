    "translated_abstract": "热泵是减少供暖领域化石燃料使用的关键技术。向热泵的转变意味着冬季寒冷月份电力需求的增加。使用开源的电力部门模型，我们研究了2030年德国的分散式热泵大规模扩张对电力部门的影响，结合不同规模的缓冲热存储。假设热泵额外使用的电力在年度平衡中必须完全由可再生能源覆盖，我们量化了可再生能源所需的额外投资。如果风力扩张潜力有限，热泵的推广也可以通过太阳能光伏在欧洲互联连接的情况下作为附加成本较小的选择。即使在时间上不灵活的热泵的情况下，对额外备用容量和电力储存的需求通常仍然有限。我们进一步发现，在2至6小时的较小热存储容量下，系统的供需平衡仍然能够得到满足。",
