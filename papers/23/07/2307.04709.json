    "translated_abstract": "在理解集体智能的过程中，香港-佩奇定理被提出作为多样性和能力相互作用的基石。然而，在经过严格的审查后，这些定理中似乎存在着固有的缺陷和误解。Hélène Landemore在她的认识论论证和政治提案中对这些定理的应用展示了对数学原则的不当使用。本文对香港-佩奇定理进行了批判性剖析，揭示了重大的不一致性和疏忽，并强调了在群体问题解决背景下，“能力”的不可或缺性。本文旨在强调不滥用数学原则的危险以及在将其应用于社会科学时更加细致的理解数学结果的必要性，而不是削弱多样性的重要性。",
    "tldr": "该论文批判性地分析了香港-佩奇定理，在探讨集体智能中多样性和能力的相互作用时，揭示了其固有的缺陷和误解。同时，该论文强调在应用数学原则于社会科学时要避免滥用，并强调了“能力”的重要性。"
