    "translated_abstract": "自主驾驶中的动态驾驶环境和多样化道路使用者的存在给决策造成了巨大的挑战。深度强化学习(DRL)已成为解决这一问题的一种流行方法。然而，由于安全问题的限制，现有的DRL解决方案的应用主要局限于模拟环境，阻碍了它们在现实世界中的部署。为了克服这一局限，本文引入了一种新颖的神经符号无模型深度强化学习方法，称为带有符号逻辑的DRL(DRLSL)，它将DRL(从经验中学习)和符号一阶逻辑知识驱动的推理相结合，以实现在实际环境下安全学习自主驾驶的实时交互。这种创新的方法提供了一种通过积极与物理环境互动来学习自主驾驶政策并确保安全性的方式。我们使用高维度数据实现了自主驾驶的DRLSL框架。",
