    "translated_abstract": "本论文研究了基于核的逼近方法在复值函数数据中的应用，其中特别关注频域中的偏微分方程的频率响应函数。在这个设置中，核方法越来越常用，然而标准的核方法表现不佳。此外，在复值情况下，底层核对的数学含义和数学推导尚待解决。我们引入了复值函数的再生核希尔伯特空间，并将带有核对的复值插值问题转化为这些空间中的最小范数插值问题。此外，我们将插值器与低阶有理函数结合，其中阶数根据一种新的模型选择准则自适应选择。来自不同领域（包括电磁学和声学）的例子的数值结果说明了该方法的性能。",

By introducing new reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of complex-valued functions and combining them with a low-order rational function, the method addresses the issue of poor performance in standard kernel methods for fitting frequency response functions."
