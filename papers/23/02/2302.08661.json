    "translated_abstract": "确保对数据集的分析代表整个样本总体是统计学中的核心问题之一。大多数经典技术假设数据集与分析师的查询无关，并在多次、自适应选择的查询中失效。这个“自适应数据分析”问题在Dwork等人（STOC，2015）和Hardt和Ullman（FOCS，2014）的开创性工作中得到了形式化。我们确定了一个非常简单的假设集，使得即使在自适应选择的情况下，查询仍然具有代表性：唯一的要求是每个查询采用随机子样本作为输入并输出少量比特。这个结果表明，子采样中固有的噪音足以保证查询的响应具有泛化性。这种基于子采样的框架的简单性使其能够模拟之前研究所未涵盖的各种实际情境。",
