Specifically, we consider the question of how efficiently, in terms of the number of parameters, deep ReLU networks can interpolate values at $N$ datapoints in the unit ball which are separated by a distance $\\delta$. We show that $\\Omega(N)$ parameters are required in the regime where $\\delta$ is exponentially small in $N$, which gives the sharp result in this regime since $O(N)$ parameters are always sufficient. This also shows that the bit-extraction technique used to prove lower bounds on the VC dimension cannot be applied to irregularly spaced datapoints. Finally, as an application we give a lower bound on the approximation rates that deep ReLU neural networks can achieve for Sobolev spaces at the embedding endpoint.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了深度ReLU神经网络的插值能力。具体来说，我们考虑深度ReLU网络如何在单位球中的$N$个数据点上进行值的插值，这些点之间相距$\\delta$。我们表明在$\\delta$在$N$指数级小的区域中需要$\\Omega(N)$个参数，这给出了该区域的尖锐结果，因为$O(N)$个参数总是足够的。 这也表明用于证明VC维度下界的位提取技术无法应用于不规则间隔的数据点。最后，作为应用，我们给出了深度ReLU神经网络在嵌入端点处为Sobolev空间实现的近似速率的下界。",
