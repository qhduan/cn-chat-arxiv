    "translated_abstract": "联合学习已经成为分布式机器学习的有效方法，通过在客户端设备上保留训练数据来确保数据隐私。然而，最近的研究强调了FL中的漏洞，包括通过单个模型更新甚至整个全局模型泄漏敏感信息。虽然关注点已放在客户端数据隐私上，但有限的研究解决了全局模型隐私问题。此外，客户端本地训练为恶意客户端启动强大的模型污染攻击开辟了途径。不幸的是，目前没有现有工作提供全面解决所有这些问题的解决方案。因此，我们介绍了HyFL，这是一种混合框架，可实现数据和全局模型隐私，并促进大规模部署。HyFL的基础是安全多方计算技术和分层联合学习的独特组合。在HyFL的训练过程中，客户端模型在多个抽象层次上进行安全聚合，以在分布式环境中提供隐私保护。实验证明，HyFL在大规模数据集上实现良好性能，同时确保客户端数据和全局模型的强大隐私和安全保障。",
