The identification of parametric choice-based demand models, such as the multinomial choice model (MNL), is typically straightforward.

In this paper, we develop a new class of nonparametric models that is not subject to the problem of nonidentifiability.

    "translated_abstract": "选择模型的鉴别对于理解消费者行为，设计营销政策和开发新产品至关重要。参数选择基于需求模型的鉴别，如多项式选择模型（MNL），通常是直接的。然而，非参数模型在解释客户选择方面非常有效和灵活，但可能会遇到维度灾难，并失去可辨识性。例如，排名模型是一个非参数模型，旨在模拟随机效用最大化（RUM）原则，已被认为光从选择概率集合本身无法辨识。在本文中，我们开发了一个新的非参数模型类别，不受非辨识性问题的影响。我们的模型假设消费者有有界理性，导致对称需求 cannibalization 并有趣地实现完全辨识。也就是说，我们可以唯一构建模型参数，以精确地解释客户选择行为。",
