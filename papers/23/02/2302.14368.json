    "translated_abstract": "去噪扩散模型在生成逼真、高质量和多样化图像方面表现出卓越能力。然而，在生成过程中的可控程度尚未得到充分探讨。受基于GAN潜在空间的图像操纵技术启发，我们训练了一个条件于两个潜在编码、一个空间内容掩码和一个扁平的样式嵌入的扩散模型。我们依赖于扩散模型渐进去噪过程的感性偏置，在空间结构掩码中编码姿势/布局信息，在样式代码中编码语义/样式信息。我们提出了两种通用的采样技术来改善可控性。我们扩展了可组合的扩散模型，允许部分依赖于条件输入，以提高生成质量，同时还提供对每个潜在代码和它们的联合分布量的控制。我们还提出了时间步相关的内容和样式潜在权重调度，进一步提高了控制性。",
