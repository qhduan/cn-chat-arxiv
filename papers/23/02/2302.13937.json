To analyze these games, I introduce a set of new concepts and mechanisms for measuring the intelligence of players, with a focus on the interplay between human- and machine-based decision-making. Specifically, I introduce two main concepts: firstly, the Game Intelligence (GI) mechanism, which quantifies a player's demonstrated intelligence in a game by considering not only the game's outcome but also the \"mistakes\" made during the game according to the reference machine's intelligence.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个新的框架——有限知识下的n人博弈，其中玩家只对游戏的某些方面（包括行动、结果和其他玩家）有限的了解。为了分析这些游戏，我介绍了一组新的概念和机制，重点关注人类和机器决策之间的相互作用。具体而言，我引入了两个主要概念：第一个是“游戏智能”（GI）机制，它通过考虑参考机器智能下的“错误”，不仅仅是游戏的结果，量化了玩家在游戏中展示出的智能。第二个是“防作弊性”，这是一种实用的、可计算的策略无关性的概念。GI机制提供了一种实用的方法来评估玩家，可以潜在地应用于从在线游戏到现实生活决策的各种游戏。",

It provides a practical way to evaluate players' intelligence and has potential applications in various games from online games to real-life decision-making scenarios."
