In both tasks, the underlying rules were generated as simple linear functions using stimulus dimensions extracted from human similarity judgments.

    "translated_abstract": "人类具备识别和概括自然物体相关特征的能力，在各种情境中有所帮助。为了研究这种现象并确定最有效的表示方式以预测人类行为，我们进行了两个涉及类别学习和奖励学习的实验。我们的实验使用逼真的图像作为刺激物，并要求参与者基于所有试验的新型刺激物作出准确的决策，因此需要泛化。在两个任务中，底层规则是使用人类相似性判断提取的刺激维度生成的简单线性函数。值得注意的是，参与者在几次试验内就成功地确定了相关的刺激特征，证明了有效的泛化。我们进行了广泛的模型比较，评估了各种深度学习模型的表示对人类选择的逐次预测准确性。有趣的是，自然语言处理任务（如语言建模和机器翻译）训练的模型表示优于视觉任务训练的模型表示，表明对齐语言的视觉表示可能更有效地预测人类在自然学习任务中的行为。",
