    "translated_abstract": "经济学和计算领域中一个流行的主题是通过市场中卖家和买家可以发现均衡价格的自然价格调整过程。这种过程的一个例子是涨跌过程，这是一种类似于拍卖的算法，由法国经济学家瓦尔拉斯在1874年首次提出，卖家根据买家的马歇尔需求调整价格。消费者理论中的一个对偶概念是买家的希克斯需求。在本文中，我们确定希克斯需求的弹性的绝对值最大值，作为一个经济参数，足以捕捉和解释广泛类市场中收敛和非收敛的涨跌行为。特别是，在价格弹性受到限制的同类菲舍尔市场中，即由同类效用函数表示的消费者偏好和价格弹性受到限制的Fisher市场中，我们证明了tâtonnement的收敛率为$O((1+\\varepsilon^2)/T)$。",
