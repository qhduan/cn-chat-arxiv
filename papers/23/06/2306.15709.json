To preserve the edges' privacy, we adopt the randomized response (RR) mechanism to perturb the network edges, which satisfies the strong notion of differential privacy.

    "translated_abstract": "现代多层网络由于隐私、所有权和通信成本的原因，常常以本地和分布式的方式存储和分析。关于基于这些数据的模型化统计方法用于社区检测的文献仍然有限。本文提出了一种新的方法，用于基于本地存储和计算的网络数据的多层随机块模型中的共识社区检测和估计，并采用隐私保护。开发了一种名为隐私保护分布式谱聚类（ppDSC）的新算法。为了保护边的隐私，我们采用了随机响应（RR）机制来扰动网络边，该机制满足差分隐私的强概念。ppDSC算法在平方的RR扰动邻接矩阵上执行，以防止不同层之间的社区相互抵消。为了消除RR和平方网络矩阵所带来的偏差，我们开发了一个两步偏差调整过程。",
