    "translated_abstract": "转移路径理论（TPT）是一种数学框架，用于量化从选定的亚稳态$A$到$B$之间的稀有转移事件。TPT的核心是Committor函数，其描述了从相空间的任何起始点到达亚稳态$B$之前到达$A$的概率。计算出Committor之后，可以立即找到转换通道和转换速率。Committor是具有适当边界条件的反向Kolmogorov方程的解。然而，在高维情况下，由于需要网格化整个环境空间，解决Committor是一项具有挑战性的任务。在这项工作中，我们探索了有限表达式方法（FEX，Liang和Yang（2022））作为计算Committor的工具。FEX通过涉及一定数量的非线性函数和二进制算术运算的固定有限代数表达式来逼近Committor。最佳的非线性函数、二进制运算和数值系数值通过深度神经网络从训练数据中学习到。我们通过解决多个高维Committor问题，其中包括高达400个维度，展示了FEX的有效性，并且表明FEX显著优于传统的数值方法，如有限元方法和有限差分方法。",

FEX achieves significantly better performance than traditional numerical methods such as finite element method and finite difference method by learning optimal nonlinear functions and numerical coefficient values through a deep neural network."
