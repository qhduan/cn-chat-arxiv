    "translated_abstract": "异质性治疗效果在经济学中非常重要，但是其评估常常受到个体治疗效果无法确定的困扰。例如，我们可能希望评估保险对本来不健康的人的健康影响，但是只给不健康的人买保险是不可行的，因此这些人的因果效应无法确定。又或者，我们可能对最低工资上涨中赢家的份额感兴趣，但是在没有观察到反事实的情况下，赢家也无法确定。这种异质性常常通过分位数治疗效果来评估，但其解释并不清晰，结论有时也不一致。我们展示了通过治疗组和对照组结果的分位数，这些数值范围是可以确定的，即使平均治疗效果并不显著，它们仍然可以提供有用信息。两个应用实例展示了这些范围如何帮助我们了解治疗效果的异质性。",
