    "translated_abstract": "自主智能体在现实环境中行动时经常需要处理未知的创新干扰其计划执行。创新是一种意外的现象，可以改变环境的核心特征、组成和动态。创新在任何足够复杂的环境中的任何时间都可能发生，而没有任何事先通知或解释。先前的研究表明，创新对智能体的性能产生灾难性影响。智能体通过世界的内在模型进行推理，以理解其环境的复杂性，并成功执行其计划。创新通常使得他们的内部模型不准确并且生成的计划不再适用。创新特别普遍在现实世界中，在其中领域特定甚至是预测的创新特定方法被用于减轻创新的影响。在这项工作中，我们展示了一个设计用于在现实环境中检测，描绘和适应创新的领域独立AI代理可以成功地将其技能转移到高保真的模拟开放世界中。我们的代理在涉及处理新颖环境干扰的多智能体规划任务中显示出了显着的改进，而且比现有的基线表现得更好。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a domain-independent AI agent that can detect, characterize, and accommodate novelty in real-world environments and successfully transfer its skills to a high-fidelity simulated open world. The agent outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in a multi-agent planning task that involves reasoning with novel environmental disturbances."
