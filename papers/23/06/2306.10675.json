    "translated_abstract": "现实世界中的末端配送数据集对于物流、供应链管理和时空数据挖掘的研究至关重要。尽管迄今已经开发了大量算法，但尚无公认的、公开可用的末端配送数据集来支持这个领域的研究。在本文中，我们介绍了LaDe，这是第一个公开可用的末端配送数据集，包含了数百万个来自产业界的包裹。LaDe具有三个独特的特点：(1)大规模。它涉及到6个月的真实运营中的10,677k个包裹和21k个快递员。(2)全面的信息。它提供原始包裹信息，如位置和时间要求，以及任务事件信息，记录了快递员何时何地进行任务接受和完成。(3)多样性。该数据集包括来自各种场景的数据，包括包裹的取送和来自多个城市的数据，每个城市都有其独特的时空属性。",
