    "abstract": "This paper presents a model for smoothly varying heterogeneous persistence of economic data. We argue that such dynamics arise naturally from the dynamic nature of economic shocks with various degree of persistence. The identification of such dynamics from data is done using localised regressions. Empirically, we identify rich persistence structures that change smoothly over time in two important data sets: inflation, which plays a key role in policy formulation, and stock volatility, which is crucial for risk and market analysis.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个模型，用于平滑变化的经济数据持久性。我们认为这种动态持续性自然而然地来源于不同持续性经济冲击的动态特性。通过使用局部回归从数据中确定这种动态持续性。经验证明，在两个重要数据集（政策制定中起关键作用的通货膨胀和对于风险和市场分析至关重要的股票波动率）中，我们确定了平稳变化的丰富持续性结构。",
