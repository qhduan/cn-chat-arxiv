    "abstract": "Assistive technologies and in particular assistive robotic arms have the potential to enable people with motor impairments to live a self-determined life. More and more of these systems have become available for end users in recent years, such as the Kinova Jaco robotic arm. However, they mostly require complex manual control, which can overwhelm users. As a result, researchers have explored ways to let such robots act autonomously. However, at least for this specific group of users, such an approach has shown to be futile. Here, users want to stay in control to achieve a higher level of personal autonomy, to which an autonomous robot runs counter. In our research, we explore how Artifical Intelligence (AI) can be integrated into a shared control paradigm. In particular, we focus on the consequential requirements for the interface between human and robot and how we can keep humans in the loop while still significantly reducing the mental load and required motor skills.",

    "translated_abstract": "辅助技术，特别是辅助机械臂已经成为帮助运动受损人士实现自主生活的可能性。近年来，越来越多这样的系统已经面向最终用户提供，例如Kinova Jaco机械臂。然而，它们大多需要复杂的手动控制，这可能会使用户不堪重负。因此，研究人员探索让这些机器人自主行动的方式。然而，至少对于这个特定的用户群体来说，这种方法已经被证明是徒劳的。在这里，用户希望保持控制权以实现更高程度的个人自治，但自主的机器人与此相反。在我们的研究中，我们探讨了如何将人工智能（AI）集成到共享控制范式中。特别是，我们关注了人与机器人之间界面的必要要求，以及如何在显著减少心理负担和所需的机动能力的同时保持人类的控制。",
