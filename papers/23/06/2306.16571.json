We define our estimand as the vector comprising both the expected number of recurrent events and the failure survival function evaluated along a sequence of landmark times. We identify the estimand in the presence of right-censoring and causal selection as an observed data functional under coarsening at random, derive the nonparametric efficiency bound, and propose a multiply-robust estimator that achieves the bound and permits nonparametric estimation of nuisance parameters. Throughout, no absolute continuity assumption is made on the underlying probability distributions of failure, censoring, or the observed data. Additionally, we derive the class of influence functions when the coarsening distribution is known and review how published estimators may belong to the class.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在存在终结事件的情况下，关于经常性事件的因果推断和高效估计。我们将估计目标定义为包括经常性事件的预期数量以及在一系列里程碑时间点处评估的失败生存函数的向量。我们在右截尾和因果选择的情况下确定了估计目标，作为观察数据的功能性，推导了非参数效率界限，并提出了一种多重鲁棒估计器，该估计器达到了界限，并允许非参数估计辅助参数。在整个过程中，我们对失败、截尾或观察数据的概率分布没有做绝对连续性的假设。此外，当分割分布已知时，我们导出了影响函数的类别，并回顾了已发表估计器如何属于该类别。在此过程中，我们强调了因果生命周期中一些有趣的不一致性。",
