    "translated_abstract": "过度参数化是深度神经网络最重要的特征之一。虽然它可以提供出色的泛化性能，但同时也强加了重大的存储负担，因此有必要研究网络剪枝。一个自然而基本的问题是：我们能剪枝一个深度网络到多么稀疏（几乎不影响性能）？为了解决这个问题，本文采用了第一原理方法，具体地，只通过在原始损失函数中强制施加稀疏性约束，我们能够从高维几何的角度描述剪枝比率的尖锐相变点，该点对应于可行和不可行之间的边界。结果表明，剪枝比率的相变点等于某些凸体的平方高斯宽度，这些凸体是由$l_1$-规则化损失函数得出的，除以参数的原始维度。作为副产品，我们证明了剪枝过程中参数的分布性质。",
