    "translated_abstract": "本文重新审视了带有全局约束的不一致数据库的修复和查询问题。采用对称差分修复，即通过删除和添加事实来恢复一致性，并假设通过对（否定）事实的二元优先关系来指定首选修复行动。我们的第一个贡献是展示如何适当地将现有的最优修复概念（仅对基于事实删除的简单拒绝约束和修复定义）扩展到我们更丰富的设置中。接下来，我们研究了所得到的修复概念的计算属性，特别是修复检查和容忍不一致查询的数据复杂性。最后，我们澄清了优先数据库的最优修复与在主动完整性约束框架中引入的修复概念之间的关系。特别地，我们表明在我们的设置中的帕累托最优修复对应于 founded、grounded 和 just。",
