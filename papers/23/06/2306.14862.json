    "abstract": "When evaluating partial effects, it is important to distinguish between structural endogeneity and measurement errors. In contrast to linear models, these two sources of endogeneity affect partial effects differently in nonlinear models. We study this issue focusing on the Instrumental Variable (IV) Probit and Tobit models. We show that even when a valid IV is available, failing to differentiate between the two types of endogeneity can lead to either under- or over-estimation of the partial effects. We develop simple estimators of the bounds on the partial effects and provide easy to implement confidence intervals that correctly account for both types of endogeneity. We illustrate the methods in a Monte Carlo simulation and an empirical application.",

    "translated_abstract": "在评估偏效应时，区分结构性内生性和测量误差非常重要。与线性模型不同，这两种内生性来源在非线性模型中对偏效应的影响不同。本文以工具变量（IV）Probit和Tobit模型为重点研究了这个问题。我们表明，即使存在有效的IV，未能区分这两种内生性类型也可能导致偏效应被低估或高估。我们开发了简单的偏效应范围估计器，并提供易于实现的置信区间，该区间正确地考虑了两种类型的内生性。我们在Monte Carlo模拟和实证应用中说明了这些方法。",
