    "translated_abstract": "可穿戴技术和智能手机提供的数字化健康干预的双重革命显著增加了移动健康（mHealth）干预在各个健康科学领域的可及性和采纳率。顺序随机实验称为微随机试验（MRTs）已经越来越受欢迎，用于实证评估这些mHealth干预组成部分的有效性。MRTs产生了一类新的因果估计量，称为“因果偏离效应”，使健康科学家能够评估干预效果随时间的变化或通过个体特征、环境或过去的反应来调节。然而，目前用于估计因果偏离效应的数据分析方法需要预先指定观察到的高维历史的特征来构建重要干扰参数的工作模型。虽然机器学习算法在自动特征构建方面具有优势，但其朴素应用导致了问题。",
