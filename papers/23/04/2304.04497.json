    "translated_abstract": "在社交网络中，发现社区结构作为各种网络分析任务中的一个基本问题受到了广泛关注。然而，由于隐私问题或访问限制，网络结构通常是未知的，这使得现有的社区检测方法在没有昂贵的网络拓扑获取的情况下无效。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了 META-CODE，这是一个统一的框架，通过探索学习辅助易于收集的节点元数据，在未知拓扑网络中检测重叠社区。具体而言，META-CODE 除了初始的网络推理步骤外，还包括三个迭代步骤：1) 基于图神经网络（GNNs）的节点级社区归属嵌入，通过我们的新重构损失进行训练，2) 基于社区归属的节点查询进行网络探索，3) 使用探索网络中的基于边连接的连体神经网络模型进行网络推理。通过实验结果证明了 META-CODE 的有效性和可扩展性。",
