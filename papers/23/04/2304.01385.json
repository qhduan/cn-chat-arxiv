    "translated_abstract": "一位委托人聘请一个代理人长期从事工作，该工作会在某个时刻突破或者崩溃。在每个时刻，代理人会私下选择工作或逃避责任。工作可以增加突破到来的速度并减少崩溃到来的速度。为了激励代理人工作，委托人会进行昂贵的检查，如果发现代理人在逃避责任，就会解雇他。我们确定了委托人的最佳检查策略。当工作主要加速突破时，周期性检查是最优的。当工作主要延迟崩溃时，随机检查是最优的。至关重要的是，代理人的行为决定了他在惩罚时间方面的风险态度。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper investigates the inspection strategy in hiring an agent for a long-term project. Periodic inspections are optimal when the agent's behavior speeds up breakthroughs, while random inspections are optimal when the agent's behavior delays breakdowns. The agent's behavior determines his risk attitude towards the timing of punishments."
