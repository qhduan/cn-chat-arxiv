    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习容易受到毒化攻击，敌对方会破坏全局聚合结果并造成拒绝服务。本文提出了一种灵活模型毒化攻击(FMPA)，旨在实现多功能攻击目标。本文考虑如下实际情景：敌对方没有关于FL系统的额外信息（例如，聚合规则或良性设备上的更新）。FMPA利用全局历史信息构建估计器，将下一轮全局模型预测为良性参考模型，并微调参考模型以获得所需的精度低和扰动小的毒化模型。FMPA不仅可以达到DoS的目标，还可以自然地扩展到启动细粒度可控攻击，从而精确降低全局准确性。本文进一步探索了FMPA在几种FL场景下的攻击性能，包括二元分类和图像分类，在不同的攻击目标和攻击知识水平下。实验结果表明，FMPA可以有效而高效地实现所需的攻击目标，同时保持隐形和不可感知。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a flexible model poisoning attack (FMPA) on federated learning that can achieve versatile attack goals including denial of service and fine-grained controllable attacks, using global historical information to construct an estimator and fine-tune a reference model to obtain the desired poisoned model with low accuracy and small perturbations. The FMPA remains stealthy and imperceptible, and experiments showed its effectiveness and efficiency under different attack scenarios."
