    "translated_abstract": "电力负载预测对于有效管理和优化电网至关重要。本文介绍了一种可解释的机器学习方法，利用算子理论框架内的数据驱动方法识别负载动态。我们使用Koopman算子来表示负载数据，该算子固有于底层动态。通过计算相应的特征函数，我们将负载动态分解为相干的时空模式，这些模式是动态的最强特征。每个模式根据其单一频率独立演化，基于线性动力学的可预测性。我们强调，负载动态是基于固有于动态的相干的时空模式构建的，能够在多个时间尺度上编码丰富的动态特征。这些特征与电网的物理特征（如季节性和小时模式）有关。我们的方法实现了最先进的预测准确性，同时提供了对底层动态的有意义的解释。",
