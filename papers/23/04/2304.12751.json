    "translated_abstract": "网络对齐（NA）是通过给定网络的拓扑和/或特征信息来发现多个网络之间的节点对应关系的任务。虽然NA方法在各种场景下取得了显著的成功，但其有效性并不总是有额外信息，如先前的锚点链接和/或节点特征。为了解决这个实际的挑战，我们提出了Grad-Align+，这是一种新颖的NA方法，建立在最近一种最先进的NA方法Grad-Align之上，Grad-Align+仅逐步发现部分节点对，直到找到所有节点对。在设计Grad-Align+时，我们考虑如何通过增强节点特征来执行NA任务，并最大限度地利用增强的节点特征来设计NA方法。为了实现这个目标，我们开发了由三个关键组成部分组成的Grad-Align+：基于中心性的节点特征增强（CNFA）、图切片生成和优化节点嵌入特征（ONIFE）。",
