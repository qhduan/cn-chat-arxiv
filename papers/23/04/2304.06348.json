    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个通用框架，基于具有结构简单的反模型的存在性（通过某些类型的宽度量来衡量，包括树宽和团宽等），为广泛的逻辑蕴含问题（简称查询）的可决定性提供了支持。作为我们框架的一个重要特例，我们确定了展现出宽度有限有限通用模型集的逻辑，保证了各种同态封闭查询的可决定性，包括了各种实际相关的查询语言。作为一个特别强大的宽度量，我们提出了Blumensath的分割宽度，该量包含了各种通常考虑的宽度量，具有非常有利的计算和结构特性。针对普遍展现存在性规则为一个展示案例，我们解释了有限分割宽度规则集包含其他已知的抽象可决定类，但借助现有的分层和受控规则集概念，也使我们能够捕获实际相关的查询语言，例如正则，连接和布尔连接查询。我们以存在规则的形式为重点，补充我们的理论结果，并进行了彻底的实验评估，展示了我们的框架在各种高级知识处理场景中的实际适用性和可伸缩性。",

The framework identifies logics exhibiting width-finite finitely universal model sets and introduces Blumensath's partitionwidth. The paper also explains how finite partitionwidth sets of rules enable the model to capture practical query languages and provides experimental evaluation."
