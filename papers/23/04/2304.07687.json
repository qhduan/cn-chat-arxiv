    "translated_abstract": "评估机器学习系统对已知分类器的学习能力允许细致地检查它们可以学习哪些模式，并在将它们应用于未知分类器的学习时建立信心。本文提出了一个名为MLRegTest的新的序列分类机器学习系统基准测试，其中包含来自1,800个正则语言的训练、开发和测试集。不同类型的形式语言代表着不同种类的长距离依赖，并正确地识别序列中的长距离依赖是机器学习系统成功泛化的已知挑战。MLRegTest根据它们的逻辑复杂度（单调二阶，一阶，命题或单项式表达式）和逻辑文字的种类（字符串，定级字符串，子序列或两者的组合）组织其语言。逻辑复杂度和文字的选择提供了一种系统方法来理解不同种类的长距离依赖和机器学习系统在处理它们时的性能。",
