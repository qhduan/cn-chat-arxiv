    "translated_abstract": "当信号和噪声混合时，物理学家通常通过信号建模来识别信号，而统计学家则相反，他们试图对噪声进行建模来识别信号。在本研究中，我们应用了统计学家的信号检测概念，对具有小样本和高维数据的物理数据进行了处理，而不对信号进行建模。自然界中的大部分数据，无论是噪声还是信号，都被假定为是由动态系统生成的；因此，在这些生成过程之间基本上没有区别。我们提出了动态系统的相关长度和样本数对于在这样的系统中生成的信号变量中区分噪声变量的实际定义至关重要。由于具有短期相关性的变量随着样本数的减少会更快地达到正态分布，因此它们被认为是“类似于噪声”的变量，而具有相反特性的变量则是“类似于信号”的变量。正态性检验不适用于小样本和高维数据，因此我们提出了一种基于样本和其邻居之间相对距离的新方法来识别“类似于噪声”的变量。实验证明，所提出的方法可以在不进行任何信号建模的情况下识别“类似于信号”的变量。",
