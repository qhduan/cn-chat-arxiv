    "translated_abstract": "现代涉及视频的AI应用（如视频-文本对齐、视频搜索和视频字幕）受益于对视频语义的细致理解。现有的视频理解方法要么需要大量注释，要么基于不可解释的通用嵌入，可能会忽略重要细节。我们提出了LASER，这是一种神经符号方法，通过利用能够捕捉视频数据中丰富的时空属性的逻辑规范来学习语义视频表示。特别地，我们通过原始视频与规范之间的对齐来公式化问题。对齐过程有效地训练了低层感知模型，以提取符合所需高层规范的细粒度视频表示。我们的流程可以端到端地训练，并可纳入从规范导出的对比和语义损失函数。我们在两个具有丰富空间和时间信息的数据集上评估了我们的方法。",
