    "abstract": "Commercial organisations are holding and processing an ever-increasing amount of personal data. Policies and laws are continually changing to require these companies to be more transparent regarding collection, storage, processing and sharing of this data. This paper reports our work of taking Booking.com as a case study to visualise personal data flows extracted from their privacy policy. By showcasing how the company shares its consumers' personal data, we raise questions and extend discussions on the challenges and limitations of using privacy policy to inform customers the true scale and landscape of personal data flows. More importantly, this case study can inform us about future research on more data flow-oriented privacy policy analysis and on the construction of a more comprehensive ontology on personal data flows in complicated business ecosystems.",

    "translated_abstract": "商业机构持有和处理的个人数据量越来越多。政策和法律不断变化，要求这些公司在收集、存储、处理和共享这些数据方面更加透明。本文报告了我们以Booking.com为案例研究，从他们的隐私政策中提取个人数据流的可视化工作。通过展示该公司如何分享其消费者的个人数据，我们提出了问题，并扩展了有关使用隐私政策告知客户个人数据流范围的挑战和限制的讨论。更重要的是，本案例研究可以为未来更以数据流为导向的隐私政策分析和在复杂商业生态系统中建立更全面的个人数据流本体论的研究提供参考。",
