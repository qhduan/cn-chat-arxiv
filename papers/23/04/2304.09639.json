We show that Past LTL corresponds to cascades of one kind of prime automata called flip-flops. In particular, the temporal operators of Past LTL are captured by flip-flops, and they cannot capture any other prime automaton, confining the expressivity within the star-free regular languages. We propose novel temporal operators that can capture other prime automata, and hence extend the expressivity of Past LTL. Such operators are infinitely-many, and they yield an infinite number of logics capturing an infinite number of distinct fragments of the regular languages",
