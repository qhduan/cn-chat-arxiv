    "translated_abstract": "人工智能已经在经济、产业、教育等各个领域产生了深远的影响，但还存在诸多限制。元学习，也称为“学习如何学习”，为通用人工智能提供了突破目前瓶颈的机会。然而，元学习起步较晚，相比CV、NLP等领域，项目数量较少。每次部署都需要大量的经验去配置环境、调试代码甚至重写，而且框架之间相对孤立。此外，目前针对元学习的专门平台和面向初学者的学习材料相对较少，门槛相对较高。基于此，Awesome-META+提出了一个元学习框架集成和学习平台，旨在解决上述问题并提供完整可靠的元学习框架应用和学习平台。该项目旨在促进元学习的发展，并将其从一个小众领域转化为一个主流的研究方向。",
