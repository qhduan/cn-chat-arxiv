    "translated_abstract": "由于推荐任务中用户-物品交互数据的自然幂律分布特性，超几何空间建模已被引入协同过滤方法中。其中，超几何GCN结合了GCN和超几何空间的优势，并取得了令人惊讶的性能。然而，这些方法仅在设计中部分利用了超几何空间的特性，由于完全随机的嵌入初始化和不精确的切线空间聚合。此外，这些工作中使用的数据主要集中在仅用户-物品交互数据中，这进一步限制了模型的性能。本文提出了一种超几何GCN协同过滤模型HGCC，它改进了现有的超几何GCN结构，用于协同过滤并纳入了附加信息。它通过在节点嵌入初始化时添加幂律偏差来保持协同图的长尾性质；然后，它直接聚合邻居节点，以提高推荐性能。",
