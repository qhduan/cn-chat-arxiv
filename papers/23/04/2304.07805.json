This becomes especially problematic in cases of extreme urgency like the COVID-19 pandemic. Automated text mining can help extract and connect information from the large body of medical research articles. The first step in text mining is typically the identification of specific classes of keywords (e.g., all protein or disease names), so called Named Entity Recognition (NER).

    "translated_abstract": "医学研究已经产生了大量出版物，PubMed数据库已经收录了超过3,500万篇研究文章。整合这些分散在大量文献中的知识可以提供有关生理机制和导致新型医学干预的疾病过程的关键见解。然而，对于研究人员来说，利用这些信息成为一个巨大挑战，因为数据的规模和复杂性远远超出了人类的处理能力。在COVID-19大流行的紧急情况下，这尤其成为问题。自动化文本挖掘可以帮助从大量医学研究文章中提取和连接信息。文本挖掘的第一步通常是识别特定类别的关键字（例如所有蛋白质或疾病名称），即命名实体识别（NER）。本文提出了一种端到端的NER工具EasyNER，用于识别医学研究文章中的典型实体，包括疾病名称、药物名称和蛋白质名称。EasyNER基于深度学习模型和基于字典的方法，旨在对自然语言处理具有不同经验水平的研究人员易于使用和定制。我们将EasyNER应用于COVID-19相关文章的数据集中并展示它可以准确地识别感兴趣的实体，为下游分析提供有用的信息。",
