    "translated_abstract": "本文系统研究了鲁棒斯塔克伯格均衡(RSE)的概念，该概念自然地推广了广泛采用的强斯塔克伯格均衡(SSE)的解决方案。RSE考虑了在斯塔克伯格博弈中可能出现的高达-$\\delta$ 子优跟随者反应，并被采用来提高领袖策略的稳健性。虽然先前的文献中已经考虑了一些鲁棒斯塔克伯格均衡的变体，但本文考虑的RSE解决方案概念重要的不同之处在于，某种意义上它放松了先前研究的鲁棒斯塔克伯格策略，并且适用于更广泛的不确定性来源。我们对几个RSE的基本属性进行了彻底的调查，包括它的效用保证、算法和可学性。我们首先证明了我们定义的RSE总是存在的，从而是严格定义的。然后我们阐明了在考虑的鲁棒性水平下领袖效用的变化情况。在算法方面，我们表明计算RSE是计算上困难的，并提出了适用于某些游戏类的有效算法来近似计算它。最后，我们研究了RSE的可学性，并表明它可以从样本中近似估计。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper provides a systematic study of the robust Stackelberg equilibrium (RSE) concept, which aims to improve the robustness of the leader's strategy by accounting for possible suboptimal follower responses in Stackelberg games. A new RSE solution concept is proposed, and its fundamental properties including utility guarantees, algorithmics, and learnability are thoroughly investigated. The existence of the RSE is proved, and efficient algorithms are proposed for approximating it for certain classes of games."
