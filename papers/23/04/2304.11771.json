    "abstract": "We study the staggered introduction of a generative AI-based conversational assistant using data from 5,000 customer support agents. Access to the tool increases productivity, as measured by issues resolved per hour, by 14 percent on average, with the greatest impact on novice and low-skilled workers, and minimal impact on experienced and highly skilled workers. We provide suggestive evidence that the AI model disseminates the potentially tacit knowledge of more able workers and helps newer workers move down the experience curve. In addition, we show that AI assistance improves customer sentiment, reduces requests for managerial intervention, and improves employee retention.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了基于生成式人工智能的对话助手在客户支持中心使用的情况，使用了5000名客户支持代理的数据。使用这个工具可以平均增加14%的生产力，以每小时解决的问题数量为衡量标准，在新手和低技能工人中的影响最大，而对经验丰富和高技能工人的影响最小。我们提供了暗示性证据表明，AI模型传播了更有能力的工人可能具有的隐含知识，并帮助新工人沿着经验曲线前进。此外，我们还表明，AI辅助改善客户情绪，减少管理干预的请求，并提高员工保留率。",
