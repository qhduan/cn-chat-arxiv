    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了贝叶斯博弈的均衡概念，这是一种具有不完全信息的基本博弈模型。我们旨在实现三种理想的平衡性质。首先，通过在博弈中引入调解者来自然地实现均衡。其次，可以以分布式方式有效地计算均衡。第三，对于广泛的博弈类别，该类均衡近似地最大化社会福利，即通过灾变代价来度量。这三种属性允许玩家计算均衡，并通过调解者使其实现，从而在近乎最优的社会福利中达成稳定状态。我们的主要结果是存在一个均衡概念，满足这三种性质。为此，我们描述了各种（不等价的）相关均衡扩展，统称为贝叶斯相关均衡。特别是，我们关注促进玩家之间交流的沟通均衡（也称为协调机制）。然后，我们提出了一种无悔动态，以分布式方式收敛于贝叶斯相关均衡。最后，我们展示了所提出的平衡概念满足三种理想的平衡性质，并呈现了证明其有效性的实验结果。",
