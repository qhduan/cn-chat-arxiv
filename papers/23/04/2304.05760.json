    "translated_abstract": "粮油指数（GOI）及其小麦、玉米、大豆、稻米和大麦等五个子指数是每日价格指数，反映了全球主要农产品现货市场价格的变化。本文对GOI及其五个子指数进行了可见性图（VG）分析。最大似然估计表明，VG的度分布都显示出幂律尾巴，除了稻米。六个VG的平均聚类系数都很大（>0.5），并与VG的平均度数展现了良好的幂律关系。对于每个VG，节点的聚类系数在大度数时与其度数成反比，在小度数时与其度数成幂律相关。所有六个VG都表现出小世界特征，但程度不同。度-度相关系数表明，玉米和大豆指数的VG表现出较弱的同配混合模式，而其他四个VG的同配混合模式较弱。",
