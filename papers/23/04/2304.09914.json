    "translated_abstract": "网络媒体已经彻底改变了政治信息在全球范围内的传播和消费方式，这种转变促使政治人物采取新的策略来捕捉和保持选民的注意力。这些策略往往依赖于情感说服和吸引。随着虚拟空间中视觉内容越来越普遍，很多政治沟通也被标志着唤起情感的视频内容和图像。本文提供了一种新的分析方法。我们将基于现有训练好的卷积神经网络架构提供的Python库fer，应用一种基于深度学习的计算机视觉算法，对描绘来自15个不同国家的政治领袖的220个YouTube视频样本进行分析。该算法返回情绪分数，每一帧都代表6种情绪状态（愤怒，厌恶，恐惧，快乐，悲伤和惊讶）和一个中性表情。",
