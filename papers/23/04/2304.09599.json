    "translated_abstract": "进化算法已成为昂贵黑盒优化的强大框架。在更少的计算成本下获得更好的解决方案对于黑盒优化至关重要且具有挑战性。最关键的障碍是找出如何有效利用目标任务信息来形成高效的优化策略。然而，当前的方法由于优化策略的表征不足以及优化策略与目标任务之间的低效交互而显得薄弱。为了克服上述限制，我们设计了一种学习进化算法（LEA），以实现从手动设计的优化策略到学习优化策略的转换，其中包括超参数和更新规则。与传统进化算法不同，LEA对目标任务具有高适应性，并且可以在更少的计算成本下获得更好的解决方案。LEA还能够有效地利用目标任务的低保真度信息来形成高效的优化策略。",
