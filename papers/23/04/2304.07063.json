    "abstract": "Reasoning on knowledge graphs is a challenging task because it utilizes observed information to predict the missing one. Specifically, answering first-order logic formulas is of particular interest because of its clear syntax and semantics. Recently, the query embedding method has been proposed which learns the embedding of a set of entities and treats logic operations as set operations. Though there has been much research following the same methodology, it lacks a systematic inspection from the standpoint of logic. In this paper, we characterize the scope of queries investigated previously and precisely identify the gap between it and the whole family of existential formulas.

    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱推理是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为它利用观察到的信息来预测缺失的信息。特别地，回答一阶逻辑公式是特别感兴趣的，因为它具有清晰的语法和语义。最近，提出了查询嵌入方法，该方法学习了一组实体的嵌入，并将逻辑运算视为集合运算。尽管有很多研究遵循相同的方法，但它缺乏从逻辑角度进行系统检查的方法。在本文中，我们描述了先前研究调查的查询范围，并准确地确定了它与整个存在性公式家族之间的差距。此外，我们还开发了一个包含十个新公式的新数据集，并讨论了同时出现的新挑战。最后，我们提出了一种来自模糊逻辑理论的新搜索算法，该算法能够解决新公式，并在现有公式中超过以前的方法。",
