    "translated_abstract": "由于在云平台上进行资源共享可以提高资源利用率并降低总体成本，因此云仍然是分布式深度学习（DL）训练作业的流行平台。然而，此类共享也为DL训练作业带来了多重挑战，例如高优先级作业可能会影响、甚至中断低优先级作业。同时，大多数现有的分布式DL训练系统要求用户在作业提交之前手动配置作业的资源（即分配给每个节点的节点数和CPU、内存等资源），并且不能在运行时调整作业的资源。作业的资源配置会深刻影响该作业的性能（例如训练吞吐量、资源利用率和完成率）。然而，这通常会导致作业性能不佳，因为用户在大多数情况下无法提供最佳的资源配置。DLRover是一种分布式DL框架，可以自动配置DL作业的初始资源并动态调整作业的资源。",
