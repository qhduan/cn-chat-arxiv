    "translated_abstract": "城市规划领域和人工智能领域曾经是独立发展的，但现在两个领域开始交叉汇合，互相借鉴和受益。本文介绍了城市规划从可持续性、生活、经济、灾害和环境等方面的重要性，回顾了城市规划的基本概念，并将这些概念与机器学习的关键开放问题联系起来，包括对抗学习、生成神经网络、深度编码器-解码器网络、对话式 AI 以及地理空间和时间机器学习等，评估了 AI 如何为现代城市规划做出贡献。因此，一个核心问题是自动化用地配置，即从周围的地理空间、人类移动、社交媒体、环境和经济活动中为目标区域生成土地用途和建筑配置。最后，本文勾画了集成 AI 和城市规划面临的一些挑战和潜在解决方案。",
