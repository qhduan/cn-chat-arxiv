    "translated_title": "GUTS：多智能体主动搜索的广义不确定性感知 Thompson Sampling算法",
    "translated_abstract": "快速灾难响应的机器人解决方案对确保最小生命损失至关重要，特别是当搜索区域对于人类救援者而言过于危险或过于广阔时。本文将这个问题建模为一个异步多智能体主动搜索任务，在此任务中，每个机器人旨在高效地在未知环境中寻找感兴趣的对象（OOI）。这种表述解决了搜索任务应该专注于快速恢复OOI而不是对搜索区域进行全覆盖的要求。先前的方法未能准确建模传感器不确定性，考虑到由于植被或地形的遮挡而导致的遮挡问题，或者考虑到异构搜索团队和硬件、通信故障的鲁棒性要求。我们提出了广义不确定性感知Thompson抽样（GUTS）算法，它解决了这些问题，并适用于在大型非结构化环境中部署异构多机器人系统进行主动搜索。我们通过仿真实验表明，GUTS算法在性能上超过现有算法高达80%。",
