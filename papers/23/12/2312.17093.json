    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们引入了一种新的持久图描述符家族。我们的方法将这些图转化为有限维向量空间中的元素，使用基于它们所引起的离散测度的泛函。虽然我们的焦点主要是在基于身份和频率的转换上，但我们并不局限于这些类型的技术。我们将这个转换家族称为LITE （Lattice Integrated Topological Embedding），并且对该家族的一些成员在1-康托洛维奇-鲁宾斯坦度量下证明了稳定性，确保对细微的数据变化具有反应性。广泛的对比分析表明，我们的描述符在拓扑数据分析文献中与当前最先进的方法相竞争，并且经常超越现有的方法。这项研究不仅为数据科学家引入了创新的观点，而且批评了目前关于向量化方法学的文献的轨迹。",
