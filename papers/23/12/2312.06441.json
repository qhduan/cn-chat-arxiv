    "translated_abstract": "基于图的欺诈检测（GFD）可视为一项具有挑战性的半监督节点二分类任务。近年来，图神经网络（GNN）已广泛应用于GFD，通过聚合邻居信息来刻画节点的异常可能性。然而，欺诈图在本质上是异质的，因此大多数GNN由于假设同质性而表现不佳。此外，由于存在异质性和类别不平衡问题，现有模型未充分利用宝贵的节点标签信息。为了解决上述问题，本文提出了一种基于半监督GNN的欺诈检测器SEC-GFD。该检测器包括混合过滤模块和局部环境约束模块，这两个模块分别用于解决异质性和标签利用问题。第一个模块从谱域的角度出发，在一定程度上解决了异质性问题。具体而言，它将图分割称不同的谱成分，",
