    "translated_abstract": "有效解释黑盒机器学习模型的决策对于依赖它们的人工智能系统的负责任部署至关重要。识别到其重要性，可以生成这些解释的可解释人工智能（XAI）领域提供了几种技术。然而，在这一不断发展的工作中，对用户（解释对象）的关注相对较少，大多数XAI技术产生的是“一刀切”的解释。为了弥合这一差距，实现更加以人为中心的XAI，我们提出了I-CEE，这是一个为用户专业知识定制图像分类解释的框架。受到现有工作的启发，I-CEE通过为用户提供信息丰富的训练数据子集（即示例图像）、相应的局部解释和模型决策来解释图像分类模型的决策。然而，与此前的工作不同的是，I-CEE模拟了示例图像的信息量依赖于用户专业知识的情况，从而为不同的用户提供不同的示例。",
