    "translated_abstract": "判断两个SQL查询之间的等价关系是数据管理和SQL生成中的一个基本问题，具有许多实际应用（即，在文本到SQL任务中评估生成的SQL查询的质量）。虽然研究界多年来一直在考虑SQL的等价性，但它存在相当大的困难，并且没有完整的解决方案。最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）在对话、问答和解决数学问题方面展现出强大的推理能力。在本文中，我们研究了LLMs是否可以用于确定两个SQL查询的等价性（语义等价和宽松等价）。为了帮助LLMs生成高质量的响应，我们提出了两种提示技术：Miniature & Mull和Explain & Compare。前一种技术被用于评估语义等价性，它要求LLMs在简单的数据库实例上执行查询，然后探索是否存在反例。",
