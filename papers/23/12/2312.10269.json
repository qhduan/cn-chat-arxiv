    "translated_abstract": "从2023年9月开始，数字服务法案(DSA)要求大型在线平台向DSA透明数据库提交关于他们在欧盟内采取的每个审核行动的详细数据。从一开始，这个集中式数据库就引起了学术界的兴趣，因为它是现实世界在线审核数据的一个前所未有的、可能是独特的宝库。在这里，我们深入分析了欧盟八个最大社交媒体平台在数据库的前100天提交的所有3.53亿条记录。具体而言，我们对平台之间进行了比较研究，包括：审核行动的数量、决策依据、应用的限制类型、审核内容类型、审核行动的及时性和提交情况，以及使用的自动化程度。此外，我们系统地与平台自己的透明报告进行了内容交叉检查。我们的分析揭示了以下结果。(i)平台只在一定程度上遵循了审核行动的哲学和方法论。",
