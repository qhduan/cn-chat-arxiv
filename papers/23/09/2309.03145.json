    "translated_abstract": "我们通过多通道流算法给出了纯探索多臂赌博机（MABs）的近似最优样本通道交换：任何使用子线性内存的流算法，其使用 $O(\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2})$ 的最优样本复杂度需要 $\\Omega(\\frac{\\log{(1/\\Delta)}}{\\log\\log{(1/\\Delta)}})$ 个通道。这里，$n$ 是臂的数量，$\\Delta$ 是最佳臂和次佳臂之间的奖励差距。我们的结果与Jin等人[ICML'21]的 $O(\\log(\\frac{1}{\\Delta}))$ 通道算法相匹配（除了低阶项），该算法仅使用 $O(1)$ 内存，并回答了Assadi和Wang[STOC'20]提出的一个悬而未决的问题。",
