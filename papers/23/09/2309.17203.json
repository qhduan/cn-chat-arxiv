Ideal unsupervised skill discovery methods are able to produce diverse and qualified skills in the absence of extrinsic reward, while the discovered skill set can efficiently adapt to downstream tasks in various ways. Maximizing the Mutual Information (MI) between skills and visited states can achieve ideal skill-conditioned behavior distillation in theory.
