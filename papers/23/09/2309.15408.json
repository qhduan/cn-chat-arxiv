This is a classical problem in computer science, with various algorithms available, such as the count-min sketch.

In this paper, we consider the sketched data as a random sample from an unknown distribution, and then we introduce novel estimators that improve upon existing approaches. Our method combines Bayesian nonparametric and classical (frequentist) perspectives, addressing their unique limitations to provide a principled and practical solution. Additionally, we extend our method to address the related but distinct problem of cardinality recovery, which consists of estimating the total number of distinct objects in the data set.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究如何仅使用通过随机哈希获得的对数据进行压缩表示或草图来恢复大规模离散数据集中符号的频率。这是一个在计算机科学中的经典问题，有各种算法可用，如计数最小草图。然而，这些算法通常假设数据是固定的，处理随机采样数据时估计过于保守且可能不准确。在本文中，我们将草图数据视为未知分布的随机样本，然后引入改进现有方法的新估计器。我们的方法结合了贝叶斯非参数和经典（频率论）观点，解决了它们独特的限制，提供了一个有原则且实用的解决方案。此外，我们扩展了我们的方法以解决相关但不同的基数恢复问题，该问题涉及估计数据集中不同对象的总数。",
