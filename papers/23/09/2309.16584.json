    "abstract": "To leverage training data for the sufficient training of ML models from multiple parties in a confidentiality-preserving way, various collaborative distributed machine learning (CDML) system designs have been developed, for example, to perform assisted learning, federated learning, and split learning. CDML system designs show different traits, for example, high agent autonomy, machine learning (ML) model confidentiality, and fault tolerance. Facing a wide variety of CDML system designs with different traits, it is difficult for developers to design CDML systems with traits that match use case requirements in a targeted way. However, inappropriate CDML system designs may result in CDML systems failing their envisioned purposes. We developed a CDML design toolbox that can guide the development of CDML systems. Based on the CDML design toolbox, we present CDML system archetypes with distinct key traits that can support the design of CDML systems to meet use case requirements.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了在保护机器学习模型的机密性的同时利用来自多方的训练数据对模型进行充分训练，研究人员开发了各种协作分布式机器学习（CDML）系统设计，例如辅助学习、联邦学习和分裂学习。CDML系统设计展示了不同的特征，例如高度的代理人自治性、机器学习模型的机密性和容错性。面对不同特征的各种CDML系统设计，开发者很难有针对性地设计满足用例要求的CDML系统。然而，不合适的CDML系统设计可能导致CDML系统无法实现其预期目的。我们开发了一个CDML设计工具箱，可以指导CDML系统的开发。基于CDML设计工具箱，我们提出了具有不同关键特征的CDML系统典型，可以支持设计满足用例要求的CDML系统。",
