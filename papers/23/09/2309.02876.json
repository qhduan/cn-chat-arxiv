    "translated_abstract": "最近，Kirkpatrick等人[ALT 2019]和Fallat等人[JMLR 2023]引入了非冲突教学，并表明它是满足Goldman和Mathias提出的防止勾结基准的最高效的机器教学模型。对于一个概念类$\\cal{C}$来说，教学图$T$将一个（教学）集合$T(C)$分配给每个概念$C \\in \\cal{C}$。如果没有一对概念与它们的教学集合的并一致，则教学图是非冲突的。非冲突教学图（NCTM）$T$的大小是$T(C)$中的最大大小，其中$C \\in \\cal{C}$。概念类$\\mathcal{B}(G)$的非冲突教学维度NCTD$(\\cal{C})$是$\\cal{C}$的一个NCTM的最小大小。类似地，NCTM$^+$和NCTD$^+(\\cal{C})$的定义是类似的，只是教师只能使用正例。我们研究了由图$G$的所有球组成的概念类$\\mathcal{B}(G)$的NCTMs和NCTM$^+$s。我们证明了与NCTD$^+$的相关决策问题{\\sc B-NCTD$^+$}是NP完全的。",
