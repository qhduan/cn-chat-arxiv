    "translated_abstract": "机器人应该存在于人类存在的任何地方: 室内、室外，甚至是未绘制的环境。然而，最近在目标导航(OGN)方面的进展主要集中在利用室内空间和语义线索来进行室内导航，而这些线索在室外不能很好地泛化。尽管这些贡献为室内场景提供了宝贵的见解，但实际的机器人应用往往扩展到室外环境，而在这些环境中存在新的挑战。与室内结构化布局不同，室外环境缺乏清晰的空间界定，并且存在固有的语义歧义。尽管如此，人类可以轻松地进行导航，因为我们能够推理未见之物。我们引入了一个新的任务OUTDOOR，用于大型语言模型(LLMs)准确地虚构可能的未来，并为推动研究提供了一个新的计算感知的成功度量标准。",
