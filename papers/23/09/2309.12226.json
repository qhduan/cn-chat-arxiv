    "translated_abstract": "纳什均衡的一个基本缺点是其计算复杂性：在正则形式的博弈中，近似纳什均衡是PPAD难的。在本文中，受到平滑分析思想的启发，我们引入了一个被称为$\\sigma$-光滑纳什均衡的松弛变种，其中$\\sigma$是光滑性参数。在$\\sigma$-光滑纳什均衡中，玩家们只需要实现至少与他们最佳$\\sigma$-光滑策略的偏离相同的效用，而这个$\\sigma$-光滑策略是不会对任何固定动作产生过多质量（根据$\\sigma$参数化）。我们区分了两种$\\sigma$-光滑纳什均衡的变种：强$\\sigma$-光滑纳什均衡，在这种情况下，玩家们需要在均衡中采用$\\sigma$-光滑策略进行游戏；弱$\\sigma$-光滑纳什均衡中，没有这样的要求。我们证明了无论是弱$\\sigma$-光滑纳什均衡还是强$\\sigma$-光滑纳什均衡，都比纳什均衡具有更好的计算性质。",
