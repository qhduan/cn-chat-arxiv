    "translated_abstract": "压缩的稀疏列（CSC）和坐标（COO）是稀疏矩阵的常用压缩格式。然而，CSC和COO都是通用格式，不能利用除稀疏性以外的数据特性，如数据冗余性。高度冗余的稀疏数据在许多机器学习应用中很常见，例如基因组学，在传统的稀疏存储格式下，这些数据通常太大无法进行内存计算。本文中，我们提出了两个扩展的CSC格式：值压缩的稀疏列（VCSC）和索引和值压缩的稀疏列（IVCSC）。VCSC利用列内的高冗余性，将数据进一步压缩了3倍以上，相比COO压缩了2.25倍，而性能特征没有显著的负面影响。IVCSC通过增量编码和字节打包压缩索引数组，使内存使用量比COO减少了10倍，比CSC减少了7.5倍。",
