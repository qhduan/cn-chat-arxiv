    "translated_abstract": "桁架结构尺寸优化是一个复杂的计算问题，强化学习（RL）适用于处理无梯度计算的多模态问题。本研究提出了一种新的高效优化算法——更新蒙特卡洛树搜索（UMCTS），用于获得合适的桁架结构设计。UMCTS是一种基于RL的方法，将新颖的更新过程和蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）与上界置信度（UCB）相结合。更新过程意味着在每一轮中，每个构件的最佳截面积通过搜索树确定，其初始状态是上一轮的最终状态。在UMCTS算法中，引入了加速选择成员面积和迭代次数的加速器，以减少计算时间。此外，对于每个状态，平均奖励被最佳奖励的模拟过程中收集来的奖励替代，确定最优解。本文提出了一种优化算法，通过结合更新过程和MCTS，以及使用UCB来优化桁架结构设计。",
