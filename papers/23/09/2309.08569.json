    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络在各种应用中对建模复杂图数据取得了巨大成功。然而，有关GNN的隐私保护的研究还很有限。在本文中，我们提出了一个学习框架，可以在不丧失太多效用的情况下为用户提供节点隐私保护。我们关注一种去中心化的差分隐私概念，即局部差分隐私，并在数据被集中服务器进行模型训练之前，对节点级别的特征和标签数据应用随机化机制进行扰动。具体而言，我们研究了在高维特征设置中应用随机化机制的方法，并提出了具有严格隐私保证的LDP协议。基于随机化数据的统计分析中的频率估计，我们开发了重构方法来近似从扰动数据中恢复特征和标签。我们还制定了这个学习框架，利用了图聚类中的频率估计。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study presents a learning framework that aims to provide node privacy protection for users in graph neural networks. It achieves this by perturbing the feature and label data at the node level through randomization mechanisms. The framework utilizes frequency estimation and reconstruction methods to approximate the original features and labels from the perturbed data."
