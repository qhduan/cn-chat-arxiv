    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一个新的去偏方法框架，用于解决高维线性回归中现代去偏技术对协变量分布的约束问题。我们研究了特征数和样本数都很大且相近的普遍情况。在这种情况下，现代去偏技术使用自由度校正来除去正则化估计量的收缩偏差并进行推断。然而，该方法要求观测样本是独立同分布的，协变量遵循均值为零的高斯分布，并且能够获得可靠的特征协方差矩阵估计。当（i）协变量具有非高斯分布、重尾或非对称分布，（ii）设计矩阵的行呈异质性或存在依赖性，以及（iii）缺乏可靠的特征协方差估计时，这种方法就会遇到困难。为了应对这些问题，我们提出了一种新的策略，其中去偏校正是一步缩放的梯度下降步骤（适当缩放）。",

    "en_tdlr": "This research introduces a new debiasing framework to address the limitations of existing techniques in high-dimensional linear regression regarding the distribution of covariates. The researchers found that current methods struggle when dealing with non-Gaussian distributions, heterogeneous design matrices, and lacking reliable estimates of feature covariance. To overcome these challenges, they propose a new strategy that utilizes a rescaled gradient descent step for debiasing correction."
