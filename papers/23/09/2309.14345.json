    "translated_abstract": "利用最新的大型语言模型（LLM），自动代码生成模型在提高软件开发编码过程的生产力和效率方面起着至关重要的作用。随着LLM在软件编码生态系统中的普及，一个紧迫的问题已经出现：生成的代码是否包含与年龄、性别和种族相关的社会偏见？这个问题关系到依赖于这些模型生成的代码的软件应用的完整性、公平性和道德基础，然而在文献中还没有得到充分探讨。本文提出了一个专为代码生成任务设计的新颖偏差评估框架。基于该框架，我们对九个最先进的基于LLM的代码生成模型的偏差进行了广泛评估。我们的发现揭示了，首先，我们评估的代码生成模型生成的31.45\\%到79.93\\%的代码函数具有偏见，9.68\\%到37.37\\%的代码函数的功能使",
