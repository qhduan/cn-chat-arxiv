    "abstract": "We suggest a new algorithm to estimate representations of compact Lie groups from finite samples of their orbits. Different from other reported techniques, our method allows the retrieval of the precise representation type as a direct sum of irreducible representations. Moreover, the knowledge of the representation type permits the reconstruction of its orbit, which is useful to identify the Lie group that generates the action. Our algorithm is general for any compact Lie group, but only instantiations for SO(2), T^d, SU(2) and SO(3) are considered. Theoretical guarantees of robustness in terms of Hausdorff and Wasserstein distances are derived. Our tools are drawn from geometric measure theory, computational geometry, and optimization on matrix manifolds. The algorithm is tested for synthetic data up to dimension 16, as well as real-life applications in image analysis, harmonic analysis, and classical mechanics systems, achieving very accurate results.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的算法，用于从紧致Lie群的有限样本轨道中估计表示。与其他报道的技术不同，我们的方法允许检索精确的表示类型，作为不可约表示的直和。而且，对表示类型的了解可以重建其轨道，有助于识别生成该作用的Lie群。我们的算法适用于任何紧致Lie群，但只考虑了SO(2), T^d, SU(2)和SO(3)的实例化。我们推导了在Hausdorff和Wasserstein距离方面的鲁棒性的理论保证。我们的工具来自于几何测度理论，计算几何和矩阵流形上的优化。算法在高达16维的合成数据以及图像分析，谐波分析和经典力学系统的实际应用中进行了测试，取得了非常准确的结果。",
