    "translated_abstract": "深度学习领域的最新进展以及深度神经网络（DNNs）在感知方面的出色性能导致了对其在自动驾驶系统中应用的增加需求。这类系统的安全性至关重要，因此需要考虑DNNs的独特属性。为了以系统综合的方式确保基于DNNs的自动驾驶系统的安全性，引入了所谓的安全考虑作为适当的结构元素。一方面，安全考虑的概念设计与现有的与自动驾驶系统安全相关的标准如ISO 21448（SOTIF）非常契合。另一方面，它已经激发了几篇学术出版物和即将出台的关于AI安全的标准，如ISO PAS 8800。虽然安全考虑的概念以前已经被介绍过，但本文对其进行了扩展和优化，借鉴了各个领域和安全专家的反馈意见。",
