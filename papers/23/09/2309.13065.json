    "abstract": "Personality profiling has been utilised by companies for targeted advertising, political campaigns and vaccine campaigns. However, the accuracy and versatility of such models still remains relatively unknown. Consequently, we aim to explore the extent to which peoples' online digital footprints can be used to profile their Myers-Briggs personality type. We analyse and compare the results of four models: logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests. We discover that a SVM model achieves the best accuracy of 20.95% for predicting someones complete personality type. However, logistic regression models perform only marginally worse and are significantly faster to train and perform predictions. We discover that many labelled datasets present substantial class imbalances of personal characteristics on social media, including our own. As a result, we highlight the need for attentive consideration when reporting model performance on these datasets and com",

    "translated_abstract": "公司利用个性化分析进行定向广告、政治宣传和疫苗宣传。然而，这些模型的准确性和多用途性仍然相对未知。因此，我们旨在探索人们的在线数字足迹能够被用来分析其迈尔斯-布里格斯人格类型的程度。我们分析和比较了四个模型的结果：逻辑回归、朴素贝叶斯、支持向量机（SVM）和随机森林。我们发现SVM模型在预测某人的完整个性类型方面达到了最佳准确率20.95%。然而，逻辑回归模型的表现只稍微差一些，并且在训练和进行预测时速度更快。我们发现许多标记数据集在社交媒体上呈现出个人特征的严重类别不平衡，包括我们自己的数据集。因此，我们强调需要在报告这些数据集上模型性能时进行仔细考虑。",
