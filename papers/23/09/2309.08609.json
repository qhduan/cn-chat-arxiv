    "abstract": "This paper aims to archive the materials behind \"Media of Langue\" by Goki Muramoto et al. Media of Langue is a new dictionary and public sculpture that depicts the map of meaning on the boundary between languages solely from the vast events of \"this word was translated into that word\" and two forces: repulsion between all words in the same language and attraction between translated words in different languages. First, the three new concepts proposed, Inter-Langue Map/Dictionary, Inter-Langue Space, and then Inter-Langue Network, are introduced, comparing them to the three domains of dictionary, semantic space, and semantic network. Next, the specific algorithms and designs implemented in the work were described.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在存档Goki Muramoto等人的《Media of Langue》后面的材料。《Media of Langue》是一个全新的字典和公共雕塑，它仅从“这个词被翻译成那个词”的广泛事件和两个力量之间的边界上描述出不同语言之间的意义地图。首先，介绍了三个新概念：《Inter-Langue Map/Dictionary》、《Inter-Langue Space》和《Inter-Langue Network》并将其与字典、语义空间和语义网络的三个领域进行了比较。接下来，描述了该作品中实施的具体算法和设计。",
