    "translated_abstract": "Arthur和Vassilvitskii提出的$k$-means++算法通常被实践者选择用于优化流行的$k$-means聚类目标，并在期望中获得$O(\\log k)$的近似度。为了获得更高质量的解，Lattanzi和Sohler提出了通过$k$-means++采样分布获得的$O(k \\log \\log k)$个局部搜索步骤的增强$k$-means++算法，从而得到$k$-means聚类问题的$c$近似解，其中$c$是一个较大的常数。在这里，我们通过考虑更大更复杂的局部搜索邻域来推广和扩展他们的局部搜索算法，从而可以同时交换多个中心。我们的算法实现了$9 + \\varepsilon$的近似比，这是局部搜索可能的最佳结果。重要的是，我们证明了我们的方法在实际中取得了实质性的改进，我们显示出与Lattanzi和Sohler的方法相比的显著质量改进。",
