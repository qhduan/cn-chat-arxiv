    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的基于模型的多智能体强化学习方法，名为Value Decomposition Framework with Disentangled World Model，旨在解决在相同环境中多个智能体达成共同目标时的样本复杂性问题。由于多智能体系统的可扩展性和非平稳性问题，无模型方法依赖于大量样本进行训练。相反地，我们使用模块化的世界模型，包括动作条件、无动作和静态分支，来解开环境动态并根据过去的经验产生想象中的结果，而不是直接从真实环境中采样。我们使用变分自动编码器和变分图自动编码器来学习世界模型的潜在表示，将其与基于值的框架合并，以预测联合动作价值函数并优化整体训练目标。我们提供实验结果。",
