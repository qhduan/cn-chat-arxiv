    "translated_abstract": "我们使用文本挖掘来确定来自Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)科学论文群体中新科学思想的来源和影响。我们验证了新技术及其相对于基于引用的传统度量指标的改进。首先，我们收集与诺贝尔奖联系的科学论文。这些论文可以说引入了对科学进展具有重大影响的全新科学思想。其次，我们确定文献综述论文，这些论文通常总结之前的科学发现而不是引领新的科学见解。最后，我们证明引领新的科学思想的论文更有可能被高度引用。我们的研究结果支持使用文本挖掘来测量发表时的新颖科学思想以及这些新思想对后续科学工作的影响。此外，研究结果还表明，相比基于论文引用的传统指标，新的文本指标有显著的改进。",
