    "abstract": "Consider the problem of estimating a random variable $X$ from noisy observations $Y = X+ Z$, where $Z$ is standard normal, under the $L^1$ fidelity criterion. It is well known that the optimal Bayesian estimator in this setting is the conditional median. This work shows that the only prior distribution on $X$ that induces linearity in the conditional median is Gaussian.  Along the way, several other results are presented. In particular, it is demonstrated that if the conditional distribution $P_{X|Y=y}$ is symmetric for all $y$, then $X$ must follow a Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we consider other $L^p$ losses and observe the following phenomenon: for $p \\in [1,2]$, Gaussian is the only prior distribution that induces a linear optimal Bayesian estimator, and for $p \\in (2,\\infty)$, infinitely many prior distributions on $X$ can induce linearity. Finally, extensions are provided to encompass noise models leading to conditional distributions from certain exponential families.",

    "translated_abstract": "在$L^1$保真度条件下，考虑从噪声观测$Y=X+Z$中估计随机变量$X$的问题，其中$Z$是标准正态分布。众所周知，在这种情况下，最优的贝叶斯估计器是条件中位数。本文表明，在条件中位数中引入线性的唯一先验分布是高斯分布。同时，还提供了其他几个结果。特别地，证明了如果对于所有$y$，条件分布$P_{X|Y=y}$都是对称的，则$X$必须服从高斯分布。此外，我们考虑了其他的$L^p$损失，并观察到以下现象：对于$p \\in [1,2]$，高斯分布是唯一引入线性最优贝叶斯估计器的先验分布，对于$p \\in (2,\\infty)$，有无穷多个先验分布可以引入线性性。最后，还提供了扩展，以涵盖导致特定指数族条件分布的噪声模型。",
