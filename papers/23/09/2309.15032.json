    "translated_abstract": "多任务学习是一种广泛使用的技术，用于从各种任务中提取信息。最近，基于系数矩阵中的稀疏奇异值分解（SVD）的稀疏正交因子回归（SOFAR）框架被引入到可解释的多任务学习中，可以发现不同层次之间有意义的潜在特征-响应关联网络。然而，由于稀疏SVD约束的正交性约束，对潜在因子矩阵进行精确推断仍然具有挑战性。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，称为基于高维流形的SOFAR推断（SOFARI），借鉴了Neyman近正交推断，并结合了SVD约束所施加的Stiefel流形结构。通过利用潜在的Stiefel流形结构，SOFARI为潜在左因子向量和奇异值提供了偏差校正的估计量。",
