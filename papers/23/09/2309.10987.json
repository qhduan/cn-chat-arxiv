    "translated_abstract": "脉冲神经网络（SNN）在许多任务中取得了成功，利用其具有潜在生物学可行性的能量效率和潜力。与此同时，神经辐射场（NeRF）以大量能量消耗渲染高质量的3D场景，但很少有研究深入探索以生物启发的方法进行节能解决方案。本文提出了脉冲NeRF（SpikingNeRF），将辐射光线与SNN的时间维度对齐，以自然地适应SNN对辐射场的重建。因此，计算以基于脉冲、无乘法的方式进行，从而减少能量消耗。在SpikingNeRF中，光线上的每个采样点匹配到特定的时间步，并以混合方式表示，其中体素网格也得到维护。基于体素网格，确定采样点是否在训练和推断过程中被屏蔽以进行更好的处理。然而，这个操作也会产生不可逆性。",
