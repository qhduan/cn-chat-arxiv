    "translated_abstract": "在程序合成中，一个智能系统接收一组用户生成的示例，并返回一个逻辑一致的程序。使用合理演说行为（RSA）框架在构建“实际”程序合成器方面取得了成功，这些合成器返回的程序不仅在逻辑上一致，而且还考虑了用户如何选择示例。然而，运行RSA算法的计算负担限制了实际程序合成在可能程序个数较少的领域的应用。本研究提出了一种通过利用“全局实际排名” - 一个单一的、总的排列所有假设的方法来分摊RSA算法的计算负担。我们证明，在使用单个演示的实际合成器中，我们的全局排名方法完全复制了RSA的排序响应。我们进一步通过实证研究显示，全局排名有效地近似了全体合理响应。",
