    "translated_abstract": "尽管大型语言模型 (LLMs)正在重新塑造人类生活的各个方面，但我们对它们的影响的理解仍然有些受限。本文研究了LLMs对人类沟通的影响，使用了消费者金融投诉的数据。通过对消费者金融保护局 (CFPB) 收集的超过820,000个投诉进行AI检测，我们发现在ChatGPT发布后不久，LLMs的使用可能性急剧增加。此外，LLMs的使用可能性与信息说服力（即从金融公司获得救济的可能性增加）呈正相关。计算语言分析表明，这种正相关可能是由LLMs增强了各种语言特征所解释的。根据这些观察研究的结果，我们假设LLMs的使用可能增强了一整套语言特征，提高了对具有不同语言背景的接收者的信息说服力。",
