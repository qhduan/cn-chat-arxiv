Identifying and eliminating such hatred is a crucial step towards a future of harmony and peace. This study presents a novel paradigm for identifying and explaining hate speech towards Islam using graph neural networks. Utilizing the intrinsic ability of graph neural networks to find, extract, and use relationships across disparate data points, our model consistently achieves outstanding performance while offering explanations for the underlying correlations and causation.",
