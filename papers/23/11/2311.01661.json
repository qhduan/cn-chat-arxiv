    "translated_abstract": "社区韧性是一个复杂且多维的现象，其源于不同社会技术系统之间的复杂非线性相互作用和其韧性特性。然而，目前关于社区韧性的研究主要集中在脆弱性评估，并采用基于指标的方法，其对于捕捉社区社会技术系统内部的异质特征及其非线性相互作用以塑造韧性的稳健性、冗余性和资源性等组成部分的能力有限。为了弥补这一差距，本文提出了一个基于三层深度学习模型的社区韧性评估方法（称为Resili-Net）。在社区社会技术系统（即设施、基础设施和社会）中，确定和计算了具体的12个可测量的韧性特征，与韧性的稳健性、冗余性和资源性三个组成部分相关。通过使用多个美国大都市统计区的公开可访问数据进行实证研究，证明了该方法的有效性。",
