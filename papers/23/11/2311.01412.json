    "translated_abstract": "揭示多元时间序列数据之间的因果关系是一个重要且具有挑战性的目标，涉及到从气候科学到医疗保健等各个学科的广泛范围。这些数据包含线性或非线性关系，并且通常遵循多个先验未知的区域。现有的因果发现方法可以从具有已知区域的异构数据中推断出摘要因果图，但在全面学习区域和相应的因果图方面存在不足。在本文中，我们介绍了CASTOR，这是一个新颖的框架，旨在学习由不同因果图统治的各种异构时间序列数据中的因果关系。通过EM算法通过最大化一个得分函数，CASTOR推断出区域的数量并学习每个区域中的线性或非线性因果关系。我们展示了CASTOR的稳健收敛性质，特别突出了其有效性。",
