    "translated_abstract": "为了在现实世界中取得成功，机器人必须应对训练过程中未曾见过的情况。本研究探讨了在部署过程中针对这些新场景的实时调节问题，通过利用先前学习到的多样化行为库。我们的方法，RObust Autonomous Modulation（ROAM），引入了基于预训练行为的感知价值的机制，以在特定情况下选择和调整预训练行为。关键是，这种调节过程在测试时的单个阶段内完成，无需任何人类监督。我们对选择机制进行了理论分析，并证明了ROAM使得机器人能够在模拟环境和真实的四足动物Go1上快速适应动态变化，甚至在脚上套着滚轮滑鞋的情况下成功前进。与现有方法相比，我们的方法在面对各种分布情况的部署时能够以超过2倍的效率进行调节，通过有效选择来实现适应。",
