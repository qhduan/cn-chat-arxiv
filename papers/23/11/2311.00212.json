    "translated_abstract": "对称性存在于自然界中，并在物理学和机器学习中扮演着越来越核心的角色。基本对称性，如庞加莱不变性，使在地球上实验室中发现的物理定律能够推广到宇宙的最远处。对称性对于在机器学习应用中实现这种推广能力至关重要。例如，在图像分类中的平移不变性允许使用参数更少的模型（如卷积神经网络）在较小的数据集上进行训练，并达到最先进的性能。本文提供了一个统一的理论和方法框架，用于在机器学习模型中以三种方式融入对称性：1. 在训练模型时强制已知的对称性；2. 发现给定模型或数据集的未知对称性；3. 在训练过程中通过学习打破用户指定的候选群体内的对称性来促进对称性。",
