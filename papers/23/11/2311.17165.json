    "translated_abstract": "理性概念在人工智能领域中占据着重要地位。无论是模拟人类推理还是追求有限最优性，我们通常希望使人工智能代理尽可能理性。尽管这个概念在人工智能中非常核心，但对于什么构成理性代理并没有统一的定义。本文调查了人工智能中的理性与非理性，并提出了这个领域的未解问题。在其他领域对理性的理解对其在人工智能中的概念产生了影响，特别是经济学、哲学和心理学方面的研究。着重考虑人工智能代理的行为，我们探讨了在某些情境中非理性行为可能是最优的情况。关于处理非理性代理的方法已经得到了一些发展，包括识别和交互等方面的研究，然而，在这个领域的工作仍然存在一些挑战和问题。",
