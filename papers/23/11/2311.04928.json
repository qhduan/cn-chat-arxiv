    "abstract": "In various work contexts, such as meeting scheduling, collaborating, and project planning, collective decision-making is essential but often challenging due to diverse individual preferences, varying work focuses, and power dynamics among members. To address this, we propose a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate group decision-making by managing conversations and balancing preferences among individuals. Our system aims to extract individual preferences from conversations and suggest options that satisfy the preferences of the members. We specifically apply this system to corporate meeting scheduling. We create synthetic employee profiles and simulate conversations at scale, leveraging LLMs to evaluate the system performance as a novel approach to conducting a user study.

    "translated_abstract": "在各种工作环境中，如会议安排、合作和项目规划中，集体决策是必不可少的，但由于个体偏好多样性、工作焦点不同和成员之间的权力动态等因素，常常具有挑战性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）来促进群体决策的系统，通过管理对话和平衡个人偏好来实现。我们的系统旨在从对话中提取个体偏好，并提出满足成员偏好的选项。我们特别将此系统应用于企业会议安排。我们利用LLM创建了合成员工配置文件，并模拟了大规模的对话，通过利用LLM评估系统表现来作为开展用户研究的新方法。我们的结果表明，系统能实现成员与LLM系统之间的高效协调，并随着时间的推移对其提出的选项进行改进和完善，确保优化系统性能。",
