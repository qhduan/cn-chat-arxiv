    "abstract": "We study the game modification problem, where a benevolent game designer or a malevolent adversary modifies the reward function of a zero-sum Markov game so that a target deterministic or stochastic policy profile becomes the unique Markov perfect Nash equilibrium and has a value within a target range, in a way that minimizes the modification cost. We characterize the set of policy profiles that can be installed as the unique equilibrium of some game, and establish sufficient and necessary conditions for successful installation. We propose an efficient algorithm, which solves a convex optimization problem with linear constraints and then performs random perturbation, to obtain a modification plan with a near-optimal cost.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了游戏修改问题，其中一位善意的游戏设计者或恶意的对手修改了一个零和马尔可夫博弈的奖励函数，以便一个目标确定性或随机的策略配置成为唯一的马尔可夫完美Nash均衡，并且在目标范围内具有价值，以最小化修改成本。我们表征了能够安装为某个游戏的唯一均衡的策略配置的集合，并建立了成功安装的充分和必要条件。我们提出了一种高效的算法，该算法通过解一个带有线性约束的凸优化问题，然后进行随机扰动，来获得一个成本近乎最优的修改计划。",
