    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑基于道路网络连接和交通流量的道路网络上的交通事故分析问题。以往的工作使用历史记录设计了各种深度学习方法来预测交通事故的发生。然而，现有方法的准确性缺乏共识，并且一个基本问题是缺乏公共事故数据集进行全面评估。本文构建了一个大规模的、统一的道路交通事故记录数据集，包括来自美国各州官方报告的900万条记录，以及道路网络和交通流量报告。利用这个新数据集，我们评估了现有的深度学习方法来预测道路网络上的事故发生。我们的主要发现是，像GraphSAGE这样的图神经网络可以准确预测道路上的事故数量，平均绝对误差不超过实际数目的22%，并能够判断事故是否会发生。",
