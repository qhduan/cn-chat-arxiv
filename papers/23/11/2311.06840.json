    "title": "Omitted Labels in Causality: A Study of Paradoxes",
    "abstract": "We explore what we call ``omitted label contexts,'' in which training data is limited to a subset of the possible labels. This setting is common among specialized human experts or specific focused studies. We lean on well-studied paradoxes (Simpson's and Condorcet) to illustrate the more general difficulties of causal inference in omitted label contexts. Contrary to the fundamental principles on which much of causal inference is built, we show that ``correct'' adjustments sometimes require non-exchangeable treatment and control groups. These pitfalls lead us to the study networks of conclusions drawn from different contexts and the structures the form, proving an interesting connection between these networks and social choice theory.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们探讨了我们所称之为“遗漏标签上下文”的概念，即训练数据仅限于可能标签的一个子集。这种设置在专业人士或特定的专注研究中非常普遍。我们利用已广泛研究的悖论（辛普森悖论和康多塞悖论）来说明在遗漏标签上下文中因果推断面临的更普遍困难。与因果推断基本原理相反，我们展示了“正确”的校正有时需要非可交换的处理组和对照组。这些陷阱引导我们研究不同上下文中得出的结论网络和其形成的结构，从而证明了这些网络与社会选择理论的有趣联系。",
