    "translated_abstract": "当资产是私有的且所有者对其主观估值存在不确定性时，重组所有权变得模糊不清。当所有权在两个所有者之间平均分配时，常用的机制是称为BMBY机制。该机制的工作原理如下：每个所有者可以通过报价来发起BMBY。一旦一个所有者声明了一个价格，另一个所有者可以选择以给定价格出售自己的持股份额或购买发起者的股份。该机制简单易实施，但无法揭示实际的所有者估值，也无法保证有效的分配，更重要的是，它限制在两个所有者之间的均等合作伙伴关系。本文将这一理论扩展到多个所有者的情况。我们提出的机制可以真实地获取所有者的估值，并具有以下几个优点：易于实施、预算平衡、防止勾结（弱集体策略证明）、个体合理、且后验有效。",
