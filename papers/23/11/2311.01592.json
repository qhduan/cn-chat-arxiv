Using the framework of aggregative games, we examine land-holding regimes where access to land is established via possession and use, and then explore the factors that may initiate decentralized privatization processes. Factors including population density, potential for technology improvement, enclosure costs, shifts in group cohesion and bargaining power, or the policy and institutional environment determine the equilibrium mix of property regimes. While decentralized processes yield efficient enclosure and technological transformation in some circumstances, in others, the outcomes fall short of second-best.

    "translated_abstract": "历史学家和政治经济学家长期以来一直在讨论导致边疆地区土地、公共领域和各种习俗土地所有制转变为更为排他形式的私人财产的过程。我们使用聚合博弈的框架，研究土地所有制体制，在这种体制下，通过占有和使用来确立对土地的获取权，然后探索可能引发去中心化私有化过程的因素。人口密度、技术改进的潜力、围地成本、群体凝聚力和谈判力变化、以及政策和制度环境等因素决定了财产制度的平衡组合。尽管在某些情况下去中心化的过程可以产生有效的围地和技术转变，但在其他情况下，结果却达不到最佳状态。这是由不同的溢出效应相互作用引起的，导致围地和技术转变的效率低于理想状态。",
