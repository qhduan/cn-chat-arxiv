    "translated_abstract": "共情是一个社交技能，表明一个个体理解他人的能力。近年来，共情引起了包括情感计算、认知科学和心理学在内的各个学科的关注。共情是一个依赖于上下文的术语，因此检测或识别共情在社会、医疗和教育等领域具有潜在的应用。尽管共情检测领域涉及范围广泛且有重叠，但从整体文献角度来看，利用机器学习的共情检测研究仍然相对较少。为此，我们系统收集和筛选了来自10个知名数据库的801篇论文，并分析了选定的54篇论文。我们根据共情检测系统的输入模态，即文本、视听、音频和生理信号，对论文进行分组。我们分别研究了特定模态的预处理和网络架构设计协议、常见数据集的描述和可用性详情，以及评估协议。",
    "tldr": "本论文对共情检测领域的机器学习研究进行了综述和分析，包括文本、视听、音频和生理信号四种输入模态的处理和网络设计，以及评估协议和数据集的描述。",
