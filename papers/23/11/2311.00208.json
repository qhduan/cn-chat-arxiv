    "abstract": "As transformers have gained prominence in natural language processing, some researchers have investigated theoretically what problems they can and cannot solve, by treating problems as formal languages. Exploring questions such as this will help to compare transformers with other models, and transformer variants with one another, for various tasks. Work in this subarea has made considerable progress in recent years. Here, we undertake a comprehensive survey of this work, documenting the diverse assumptions that underlie different results and providing a unified framework for harmonizing seemingly contradictory findings.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着transformers在自然语言处理中的重要性日益突出，一些研究人员开始从理论上探讨它们能否解决问题，将问题视为形式语言。探索这类问题将有助于比较transformers与其他模型以及不同变种之间的差异，适用于各种任务。近年来，在这个子领域的工作取得了相当大的进展。本文对这方面的工作进行了全面调查，记录了不同结果背后的各种假设，并提供了一个统一的框架，以协调看似相互矛盾的研究结果。",
