    "translated_abstract": "先前对图神经网络的攻击主要集中在图毒化和规避上，忽略了网络的权重和偏置。传统的基于权重的故障注入攻击，如用于卷积神经网络的位反转攻击，没有考虑到图神经网络的独特属性。我们提出了注入率位反转攻击（Injectivity Bit Flip Attack），这是第一个专门针对图神经网络设计的位反转攻击。我们的攻击针对量化消息传递神经网络中的可学习邻域聚合函数，降低了其区分图结构的能力，失去了Weisfeiler-Lehman测试的表达能力。我们的发现表明，利用特定于某些图神经网络架构的数学属性可能会显著增加其对位反转攻击的易受攻击性。注入率位反转攻击可以将各种图属性预测数据集上训练的最大表达性同构网络降级为随机输出。",
