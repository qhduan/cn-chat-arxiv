    "translated_abstract": "鉴于机器学习中公平性问题日益受到关注以及图神经网络（GNN）在图数据学习上的卓越表现，GNN中的算法公平性受到了广泛关注。虽然许多现有的研究在群体层面上改善了公平性，但只有少数工作促进了个体公平性，这使得相似的个体具有相似的结果。促进个体公平性的理想框架应该（1）在公平性和性能之间平衡，（2）适应两种常用的个体相似性度量（从外部注释和从输入特征计算），（3）横跨各种GNN模型进行推广，（4）具有高效的计算能力。不幸的是，之前的工作都没有实现所有的理想条件。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的方法GFairHint，该方法通过辅助链接预测任务学习公平表示，然后将其与原始图嵌入连接以增强个体公平性。实验结果表明，GFairHint在不牺牲太多性能的情况下提高了个体公平性，并且优于目前的最新方法。",
