    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了基于异构数据源的观测数据学习个性化决策政策的问题。此外，我们在联邦设置中研究了这个问题，其中中央服务器旨在在分布在异构源上的数据上学习一个政策，而不交换它们的原始数据。我们提出了一个联邦政策学习算法，它基于使用双重稳健线下策略评估和学习策略训练的本地策略聚合的方法。我们提供了一种新的后悔分析方法来确立对全局后悔概念的有限样本上界，这个全局后悔概念跨越了客户端的分布。此外，我们针对每个单独的客户端建立了相应的局部后悔上界，该上界由相对于所有其他客户端的分布变化特征性地描述。我们用实验结果支持我们的理论发现。我们的分析和实验提供了异构客户端参与联邦学习的价值洞察。",
