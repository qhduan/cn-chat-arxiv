    "translated_abstract": "慈善通常由个人捐赠者或中央组织（如政府或市政机构）进行，他们收集个人捐款并将它们分配给一组慈善机构。一方面，个人慈善尊重捐赠者的意愿，但由于缺乏协调而可能效率低下。另一方面，集中慈善可能更有效，但可能忽略个人捐赠者的意愿。我们提出了一种机制，它结合了两种方法的优点，通过以高效的方式分配每个捐赠者的贡献，没有任何捐助人有动机重新分配他们的捐款。在假设Leontief效用函数（即每个捐赠者均希望最大化所有慈善机构的最小贡献的个人加权之和）的情况下，我们的机制是组策略正确、偏好单调、贡献单调、最大化纳什福利并可以计算。",

The mechanism is group-strategyproof, preference-monotonic, contribution-monotonic, maximizes Nash welfare, and can be computed under the assumption of Leontief utilities."
