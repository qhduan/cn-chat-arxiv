    "translated_abstract": "在强调医疗保健、早期教育和健身方面，越来越多的非侵入式测量和识别方法受到关注。压力感应由于其简单的结构、易于访问、可视化应用和无害性而得到广泛研究。本文介绍了一种基于压敏材料Velostat的智能压力电子垫(SP e-Mat)系统，用于人体监测应用，包括睡眠姿势、运动和瑜伽识别。在子系统扫描电子垫读数并处理信号后，它生成一个压力图像流。采用深度神经网络(DNNs)来拟合和训练压力图像流，并识别相应的人类行为。四种睡眠姿势和受Nintendo Switch Ring Fit Adventure(RFA)启发的五种动态活动被用作拟议的SPeM系统的初步验证。SPeM系统在两种应用中均达到了较高的准确性，这证明了其高精度和。",
