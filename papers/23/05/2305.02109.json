    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is the most popular distributed machine learning technique. However, implementation of FL over modern wireless networks faces key challenges caused by (i) dynamics of the network conditions, (ii) coexistence of multiple FL services/tasks in the system, and (iii) concurrent execution of FL services with other network services, which are not jointly considered in prior works. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce a generic FL paradigm over next-generation (NextG) networks, called dynamic multi-service FL (DMS-FL). We identify three unexplored design considerations in DMS-FL: (i) FL service operator accumulation, (ii) wireless resource fragmentation, and (iii) signal strength fluctuations. We take the first steps towards addressing these design considerations through proposing a novel distributed ML architecture called elastic virtualized FL (EV-FL). EV-FL unleashes the full potential of Open RAN (O-RAN) systems and introduces an elastic resource provisioning",

    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习是最流行的分布式机器学习技术，但是在现代无线网络中实现联邦学习面临着许多挑战，主要包括网络条件的动态性、系统中多个联邦学习服务/任务的并存以及联邦学习服务与其他网络服务的并行执行等。针对这些挑战，本文提出了一种名为动态多服务联邦学习（DMS-FL）的联邦学习泛型架构，并通过提出一种新的分布式机器学习架构——弹性虚拟化联邦学习（EV-FL）来解决DMS-FL中的三个未探索的设计问题。",
