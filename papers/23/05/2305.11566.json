    "abstract": "We present a lightweight system for stereo matching through embedded GPUs. It breaks the trade-off between accuracy and processing speed in stereo matching, enabling our embedded system to further improve the matching accuracy while ensuring real-time processing. The main idea of our method is to construct a tiny neural network based on variational auto-encoder (VAE) to upsample and refinement a small size of coarse disparity map, which is first generated by a traditional matching method. The proposed hybrid structure cannot only bring the advantage of traditional methods in terms of computational complexity, but also ensure the matching accuracy under the impact of neural network. Extensive experiments on the KITTI 2015 benchmark demonstrate that our tiny system exhibits high robustness in improving the accuracy of the coarse disparity maps generated by different algorithms, while also running in real-time on embedded GPUs.",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了通过嵌入式GPU实现的轻量级立体匹配系统-StereoVAE，它打破了立体匹配中精度和处理速度之间的平衡，使得我们的嵌入式系统能够在保证实时处理的同时进一步提高匹配精度。我们的方法的主要思想是构建一个基于变分自编码器（VAE）的小型神经网络，对传统匹配方法生成的小尺寸粗糙视差图进行上采样与细化。这种混合结构不仅可以带来传统方法的计算复杂度优势，还可以保证神经网络的影响下的匹配精度。对KITTI 2015基准测试的广泛实验表明，我们的轻量级立体匹配系统在提高由不同算法生成的粗糙视差图的准确性方面表现出高鲁棒性，同时在嵌入式GPU上实时运行。",
