    "abstract": "This study employs the annual unbalanced panel data of 42 listed banks in China from 2006 to 2021, adopts the non-radial and non-oriented super-efficiency Data envelopment analysis (Super-SBM-UND-VRS based DEA) model considering NPL as undesired output. Our results show that the profitability super-efficiency of State-owned banks and Rural/City Commercial Banks is better than that of Joint-stock Banks. In terms of intermediary efficiency(deposit and loan), state-owned banks have advantage on other two type of banks. The determinants analysis shows that all type of banks significantly benefits from the decrease of ownership concentration which support reformation and IPO. Regional commercial banks significantly benefit from the decrease of customer concentration and the increase of reserves. On the other hand, State-owned banks should increase its loan to deposit ratio while joint-stock banks should do the opposite.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究采用2006至2021年42家上市银行的年度非平衡面板数据，采用考虑不良贷款为不希望产出的非径向非定向超效率数据包络分析（Super-SBM-UND-VRS based DEA）模型。结果显示，国有银行和城市/农村商业银行的盈利能力超效率优于股份制银行。就中介效率（存款和贷款）而言，国有银行具有优势。决定因素分析表明，所有类型的银行都受益于所有权集中度的降低，支持改革和IPO。地方商业银行显著受益于客户集中度的降低和准备金的增加。另一方面，国有银行应增加其贷款存款比率，而股份制银行应采取相反的措施。",
