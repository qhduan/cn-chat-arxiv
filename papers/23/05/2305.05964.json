    "translated_abstract": "在线社交平台上的多模态虚假信息由于多媒体内容的可信度和传播更容易而变得越来越重要。虽然现有的多模态检测方法已经达到了较高的性能，但缺乏解释性阻碍了这些系统的可靠性和实际部署。受到 NeuralSymbolic AI 的启发，该方法结合了神经网络的学习能力和符号学习的可解释性，我们提出了一种新的基于逻辑的多模态虚假信息检测神经模型，它集成了可解释性逻辑子句以表达目标任务的推理过程。为了使学习有效，我们使用神经表征来参数化符号逻辑元素，从而便于自动生成和评估有意义的逻辑子句。另外，为了使我们的框架可适用于各种虚假信息来源，我们在多模态融合网络中引入了五个元预测器来捕获虚假信息的基本模式。我们在实际的多模态虚假信息数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明，我们的模型不仅显着优于现有方法，还为每个预测提供了透明且可解释的逻辑推理过程。",

The model parameterizes symbolic logical elements using neural representations and introduces five meta-predictors in a multimodal fusion network to capture essential misinformation patterns. The results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and provides transparent and interpretable logical reasoning process for each prediction."
