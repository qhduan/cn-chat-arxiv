    "abstract": "Millions of users come to online peer counseling platforms to seek support on diverse topics ranging from relationship stress to anxiety. However, studies show that online peer support groups are not always as effective as expected largely due to users' negative experiences with unhelpful counselors. Peer counselors are key to the success of online peer counseling platforms, but most of them often do not have systematic ways to receive guidelines or supervision. In this work, we introduce CARE: an interactive AI-based tool to empower peer counselors through automatic suggestion generation. During the practical training stage, CARE helps diagnose which specific counseling strategies are most suitable in the given context and provides tailored example responses as suggestions. Counselors can choose to select, modify, or ignore any suggestion before replying to the support seeker. Building upon the Motivational Interviewing framework, CARE utilizes large-scale counseling conversation data",

    "translated_abstract": "数百万用户来到在线同侪辅导平台寻求关于从关系压力到焦虑等多种主题的支持。然而，研究表明，在线同侪支持群体并不总是像预期的那样有效，这主要是由于用户与无用的辅导员产生了负面体验。同侪辅导员是在线同侪辅导平台成功的关键，但他们中的大多数通常没有系统地接收指导或监督的方式。在这项工作中，我们介绍 CARE：一个交互式的基于 AI 的工具，通过自动建议生成增强同侪辅导员的能力。在实际培训阶段，CARE 帮助诊断在给定情境下哪些具体的辅导策略最合适，并提供量身定制的示例响应作为建议。辅导员可以选择在回复求助者之前选择、修改或忽略任何建议。",
