However, many of the methods used rely on general-purpose solvers for which scalability remains an issue. Dynamic programming methods have been shown to scale much better because they exploit the tree structure by solving subtrees as independent subproblems. However, this only works when an objective can be optimized separately for subtrees. We explore this relationship in detail and show necessary and sufficient conditions for such separability and generalize previous dynamic programming approaches into a framework that can optimize any combination of separable objectives and constraints. Experiments on four application domains show the general applicability of this framework, while outperforming the scalability of general-purpose solvers by a large margin.",

    "translated_abstract": "决策树的全局优化在准确性，大小和人类可理解性方面表现出良好的前景。然而，许多方法仍然依赖于通用求解器，可扩展性仍然是一个问题。动态规划方法已被证明具有更好的可扩展性，因为它们通过将子树作为独立的子问题解决来利用树结构。然而，这仅适用于可以分别优化子树的任务。我们详细研究了这种关系，并展示了实现这种可分离约束和目标任意组合的动态规划方法。在四个应用领域的实验表明了这种方法的普适性，同时也比通用求解器具有更好的可扩展性。",
