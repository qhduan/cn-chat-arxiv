    "translated_abstract": "无监督的源分离涉及通过混合操作记录的未知源信号的分解，其中对源的先验知识有限，仅可以访问信号混合数据集。这个问题本质上是不适用的，并且进一步受到时间序列数据中源展现出的多种时间尺度的挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种无监督的多尺度聚类和源分离框架，通过利用小波散射协方差来提供随机过程的低维表示，能够区分不同的非高斯随机过程。在这个表示空间中，我们开发了一个因子高斯混合变分自动编码器，它被训练用于(1)概率地对不同时间尺度上的源进行聚类和逐层非监督源分离，(2)在每个时间尺度上提取低维表示，(3)学习源信号的因子表示，(4)在表示空间中进行采样，以生成未知源信号。我们在MRO上的三个频道的可见数据集上进行了评估，结果表明所提出的方法比目前最先进的技术具有更好的性能。",
