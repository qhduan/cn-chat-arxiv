    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络在图学习领域取得了巨大成功，但遇到异质性时会出现性能下降，即因为局部和统一聚合而导致的相邻节点不相似。现有的异质性图神经网络中，试图整合全局聚合的尝试通常需要迭代地维护和更新全图信息，对于一个具有 $n$ 个节点的图，这需要 $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ 的计算效率，从而导致对大型图的扩展性较差。在本文中，我们提出了 SIMGA，一种将 SimRank 结构相似度测量作为全局聚合的 GNN 结构。 SIMGA 的设计简单，且在效率和有效性方面都有着有 promising 的结果。SIMGA 的简单性使其成为第一个可以实现接近于线性的 $n$ 传播效率的异质性 GNN 模型。我们从理论上证明了它的有效性，将 SimRank 视为 GNN 的一种新解释，并证明了汇聚节点表示的有效性。",
