    "abstract": "Going beyond 'dendritic democracy', we introduce a 'democracy of local processors', termed Cooperator. Here we compare their capabilities when used in permutation-invariant neural networks for reinforcement learning (RL), with machine learning algorithms based on Transformers, such as ChatGPT. Transformers are based on the long-standing conception of integrate-and-fire 'point' neurons, whereas Cooperator is inspired by recent neurobiological breakthroughs suggesting that the cellular foundations of mental life depend on context-sensitive pyramidal neurons in the neocortex which have two functionally distinct points. We show that when used for RL, an algorithm based on Cooperator learns far quicker than that based on Transformer, even while having the same number of parameters.",

    "translated_abstract": "在超越“树突民主”之上，我们引入了一个名为Cooperator的“本地处理器民主”。在这里，我们将它们与基于Transformers的机器学习算法（例如ChatGPT）在置换不变神经网络强化学习（RL）中的功能进行比较。 Transformers基于长期以来的“积分-发射”“点”神经元的概念，而Cooperator则受到最近神经生物学突破的启示，这些突破表明，精神生活的细胞基础取决于新皮层中具有两个功能上不同点的上皮神经元。我们表明，当用于RL时，基于Cooperator的算法学习速度比基于Transformer的算法快得多，即使它们具有相同数量的参数。",
