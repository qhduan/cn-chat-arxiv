    "abstract": "In this paper we present a new method to trace the flows of phosphate from the countries where it is mined to the counties where it is used in agricultural production. We achieve this by combining data on phosphate rock mining with data on fertilizer use and data on international trade of phosphate-related products. We show that by making certain adjustments to data on net exports we can derive the matrix of phosphate flows on the country level to a large degree and thus contribute to the accuracy of material flow analyses, a results that is important for improving environmental accounting, not only for phosphorus but for many other resources.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种跟踪磷从开采国到农业生产国使用的新方法。我们通过将磷岩采矿数据与化肥使用数据和磷相关产品的国际贸易数据相结合来实现目标。我们展示了通过对净出口数据进行某些调整，我们可以在很大程度上推导出国家层面上的磷流矩阵，并因此为物质流分析的准确性做出贡献，这对于改进环境会计不仅对于磷，还适用于许多其他资源至关重要。",
