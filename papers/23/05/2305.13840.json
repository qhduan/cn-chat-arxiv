    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于控制信号的可控文本生成视频（T2V）扩散模型，称为Video-ControlNet。该模型是在预训练的有条件文本生成图像（T2I）扩散模型基础上构建的，其中包括一种空间-时间自注意机制和可训练的时间层，用于有效的跨帧建模。提出了一种第一帧条件策略，以促进模型在自回归方式下生成转换自图像领域以及任意长度视频。此外，Video-ControlNet采用一种基于残差的噪声初始化策略，从输入视频中引入运动先验，从而产生更连贯的视频。通过提出的架构和策略，Video-ControlNet可以实现资源高效的收敛，生成具有细粒度控制的优质一致视频。广泛的实验证明了它的成功。",
