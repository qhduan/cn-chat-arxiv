    "translated_abstract": "经验研究通常涉及到鲁棒性和效率之间的权衡。研究人员想要估计一个标量参数，可以使用强假设来设计一个精准但可能存在严重偏差的局限估计量，也可以放松一些假设并设计一个更加鲁棒但变量较大的估计量。当局限估计量的偏差上限已知时，将无限制估计量收缩到局限估计量是最优的。对于局限估计量偏差上限未知的情况，我们提出了自适应收缩估计量，该估计量最小化最坏风险相对于已知偏差上限的理论最优估计量的最大风险的百分比增加。我们证明自适应估计量是一个加权凸最小化最大问题，并提供查找表以便于快速计算。重新审视了五项存在模型规范问题的经验研究，我们研究了适应错误的模型的优势而不是检验。",

It tries to solve the tradeoff between robustness and efficiency in empirical research and avoids the complexity of model testing."
