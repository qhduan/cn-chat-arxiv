    "translated_abstract": "我们提供了实用、高效、非参数方法，用于审计已部署的分类和回归模型的公平性。相比之前依赖于固定样本量的方法，我们的方法是序贯的，并允许对不断产生的数据进行连续的监控，因此非常适用于跟踪现实世界系统的公平性。我们也允许数据通过概率策略进行收集，而不是从人口中均匀采样。这使得审计可以在为其他目的收集的数据上进行。此外，该策略可以随时间改变，并且不同的子人群可以使用不同的策略。最后，我们的方法可以处理因模型变更或基础人群变更导致的分布漂移。我们的方法基于最近关于 anytime-valid 推断和博弈统计学的进展，尤其是\"通过赌博进行测试\"框架。这些联系确保了我们的方法具有可解释性、快速和提供统计保证。",
