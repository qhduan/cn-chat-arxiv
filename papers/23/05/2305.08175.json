    "translated_abstract": "扰动的边缘数据是一种常见的保护数据隐私的形式，可用于诸如列联表分析、贝叶斯网络构建和合成数据生成等下游任务。我们提出了ResidualPlanner，这是一种用于带有高斯噪声的边缘的矩阵机制，既优化又可扩展。ResidualPlanner可以优化许多可以写成边际方差的凸函数的损失函数。此外，ResidualPlanner可以在几秒钟内优化大规模设置中的边缘准确性，即使之前的最先进技术（HDMM）也会占用过多的内存。甚至在具有100个属性的数据集上也可以在几分钟内运行。此外，ResidualPlanner还可以有效地计算每个边缘的方差/协方差值（之前的方法会很快失败）。",
