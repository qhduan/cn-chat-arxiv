    "translated_abstract": "通过语音通讯进行地空协商是确保空中交通管制（ATC）操作安全和效率的重要前提。但是，随着交通流量的增加，由于人为因素导致的错误指令给ATC安全带来了巨大威胁。现有的飞行轨迹预测（FTP）方法主要依赖于历史轨迹的飞行状态，在实时机动指令的预测上会出现显著的延迟，这不利于冲突检测。本文提出了一种名为SIA-FTP的语音指令感知FTP框架，通过包含即时的语音指令来支持高机动FTP任务。为了解决模态差距并最小化数据需求，我们提出了一种联合注意机制来融合语音指令嵌入和飞行轨迹表示。在多个真实世界数据集上评估了所提出的SIA-FTP，与现有的FTP方法相比取得了显著的改进。",

    "en_tdlr": "A spoken instruction-aware FTP framework called SIA-FTP is proposed to support high-maneuvering FTP tasks with the incorporation of instant spoken instruction. By fusing the spoken instruction embedding and the flight trajectory representation with a joint attention mechanism, the framework provides significant improvement compared to existing FTP methods on multiple real-world datasets."
