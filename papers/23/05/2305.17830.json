    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在研究大银行对金融系统稳定性的影响。为此，我们采用一个线性二次高斯（LQG）均场博弈（MFG）模型来研究跨行业市场，其中包括一个大银行和多个小银行。我们采用MFG方法推导每个银行的最优交易策略，并得出市场的均衡状态。随后，我们进行Monte Carlo模拟，探讨大银行在各种情况下对系统性风险扮演的角色。我们的研究发现，虽然大银行如果规模不太大可以对稳定性产生积极的贡献，但在违约事件中也有可能产生负面溢出效应，导致系统性风险增加。我们还发现，随着银行对跨行业市场的依赖程度越来越高，整个系统变得更加稳定，但罕见系统性崩溃的概率也会增加。而大银行的存在进一步放大了这种风险。",
