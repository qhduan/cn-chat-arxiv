    "translated_abstract": "在许多工业应用中，群体数据是普遍存在的。机器和基础设施越来越多地配备了传感系统，发出具有复杂相互依赖关系的遥测数据流。实际上，数据中心的监测程序倾向于将这些资产（以及各自的模型）视为不同的实体 - 独立运行并与独立数据相关联。相反，这项工作捕捉了一组系统模型之间的统计相关性和相互依赖关系。利用贝叶斯多级方法，数据的价值可以得到扩展，因为可以将人群作为一个整体来考虑，而不是作为组成部分。最有趣的是，领域专业知识和基础物理知识可以在系统、子组或人群水平上编码到模型中。我们提供了一个声发射（到达时间）映射源位置的示例，以说明多级模型如何自然地适用于表示。",
