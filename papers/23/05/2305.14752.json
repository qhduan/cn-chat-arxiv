Initially, we employ Bounded Model Checking (BMC) to locate the software vulnerability and derive a counterexample. The counterexample provides evidence that the system behaves incorrectly or contains a vulnerability. The counterexample that has been detected, along with the source code, are provided to the LLM engine. Our approach involves establishing a specialized prompt language for conducting code debugging and generation to understand the vulnerability's root cause and repair the code.

As a proof of concept, we create ESBMC-AI based on the Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC) and a pre-trained Transformer model, specifically gpt-3.5-turbo, to detect and fix errors in C program",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新方法，将大语言模型和形式化验证策略相结合，使得软件漏洞可以得到验证和自动修复。首先利用有限模型检查（BMC）定位软件漏洞和派生反例。然后，将反例和源代码提供给大语言模型引擎进行代码调试和生成，从而找到漏洞的根本原因并修复代码。最后，则使用BMC验证大语言模型生成的修正版本的代码。 作为概念证明，我们创建了ESBMC-AI，它基于高效的基于SMT的上下文有界模型检查器（ESBMC）和一个预训练的Transformer模型gpt-3.5-turbo来检测和修复C程序中的错误。",
