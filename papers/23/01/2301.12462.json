    "translated_abstract": "渗透测试是当只能通过消耗资源的能力来衡量资源容量时，选择高容量资源的问题。我们有一组$n$只笔，每只笔都有未知的墨水量，我们的目标是选择一个可行的笔集合，使其中墨水总量最大。我们可以通过使用它们来获得更多信息，但这将消耗先前存在于笔中的墨水。算法将与标准基准（即最优的渗透测试算法）和全知基准（即如果了解笔中墨水的数量，则最优的选择）进行评估。我们通过将延迟接受拍卖和虚拟价值的拍卖理论框架类比，确定了最优和近似最优的渗透测试算法。我们的框架允许将任何近似最优的延迟接受机制转换为近似最优的渗透测试算法。此外，这些算法保证在逼近程度上存在额外开销至多$(1+o(1)) \\ln n$。",
