    "translated_abstract": "数据驱动的方法结合物理学知识是建模系统的强有力技术。此类模型的目标是通过将测量结果与已知物理定律相结合，高效地求解基本场。由于许多系统包含未知元素，如缺失参数、嘈杂数据或不完整的物理定律，因此这通常被视为一种不确定性量化问题。处理所有变量的常见技术通常取决于用于近似后验的数值方案，并且希望有一种不依赖于任何离散化的方法。信息场理论（IFT）提供了对不一定是高斯场的场进行统计学的工具。我们通过将描述场的物理定律的信息编码为函数先验来扩展IFT到物理信息场理论（PIFT）。从这个PIFT得出的后验与任何数值方案无关，并且可以捕捉多种模式。",
