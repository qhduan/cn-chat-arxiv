One important class of treatment policies for practice, namely multi-stage stationary treatment policies, prescribe treatment assignment probabilities using the same decision function over stages, where the decision is based on the same set of features consisting of both baseline variables (e.g., demographics) and time-evolving variables (e.g., routinely collected disease biomarkers). Although there has been extensive literature to construct valid inference for the value function associated with the dynamic treatment policies, little work has been done for the policies themselves, especially in the presence of high dimensional feature variables.

    "translated_abstract": "动态治疗规则是一系列针对个体特征量身定制的多阶段决策函数。在实践中，一类重要的治疗策略是多阶段静态治疗策略，其使用相同的决策函数来指定治疗分配概率，在决策时基于同时包括基线变量（例如人口统计学）和时变变量（例如常规检测到的疾病生物标志物）的一组特征。虽然已经有大量文献对与动态治疗策略相关的价值函数进行有效推断，但在高维特征变量存在的情况下，对于治疗策略本身的工作还很少。我们旨在填补这项工作的空白。具体而言，我们首先基于增强的倒数权重估计器估计多阶段静态治疗策略，以提高价值函数的准确性。",
