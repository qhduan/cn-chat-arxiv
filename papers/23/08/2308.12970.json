    "translated_abstract": "布料模拟是一个广泛研究的问题，在计算机图形学文献中有大量的解决方案。现有的布料模拟器产生符合不同类型边界条件的逼真布料变形。然而，它们的操作原理在几个方面仍然存在局限性：它们在具有固定空间分辨率的显式表面表示上进行操作，执行一系列离散化的更新（限制了它们的时间分辨率），并且需要相对较大的存储空间。此外，通过现有的求解器进行梯度反向传播通常并不直观，这在将其集成到现代神经架构中时造成了额外的挑战。针对上述限制，本文从根本上以一种根本不同的视角来考虑物理合理的布料模拟，并重新思考这个长期存在的问题：我们提出了NeuralClothSim，即一种使用薄壳的新布料模拟方法，其中表面演化通过神经变形场等进行。",
