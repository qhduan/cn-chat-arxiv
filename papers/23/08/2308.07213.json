    "translated_abstract": "专业事实核查在应对大量虚假信息方面存在可扩展性有限的挑战。虽然提出了许多自然语言处理工具来增强事实核查的效率和可扩展性，但学术研究和事实核查组织均报告了对此类工具的有限采用，因为这些工具不足以与事实核查员的实践、价值观和需求保持一致。为了弥补这一差距，我们研究了一种合作设计方法，即AI的匹配设计，该方法促进事实核查员、设计师和自然语言处理研究人员共同发现应以何种方式解决事实核查员的需求。我们与22名专业事实核查员进行的合作设计会议产生了11个新的设计思路。这些思路有助于提高信息搜索、处理和撰写效率以及个性化的事实核查；帮助事实核查员主动准备未来的虚假信息；监测潜在的偏见；并支持内部组织。",
