    "translated_abstract": "解决道路交通所造成的负外部性问题的可持续解决方案是用电动汽车（EVs）取代内燃机动车，尤其是包括插电式混合动力汽车（PHEV）和电池电动汽车（BEV）在内的插电式电动汽车（PEV）。然而，EV的市场份额仍然很低，预计将保持低位且不确定。这说明有必要深入了解EV采纳行为，重点关注大规模EV采纳的主要障碍之一，即电动驾驶里程的限制。本研究从两个方向扩展了现有文献。首先，探讨了心理因素对EV采纳行为的影响，即所谓的里程焦虑，通过提出一个嵌套逻辑模型（NL）模型来进行实证研究。其次，两层次的NL模型捕捉了个人在车辆交易类型和EV类型方面的决策，其中上层模型为选择的车辆交易类型提供了决策。",
