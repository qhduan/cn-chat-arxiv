    "translated_abstract": "用户侧群体公平性对现代推荐系统至关重要，它旨在减轻由敏感属性（如性别、种族或年龄）定义的用户群体之间的性能差异。我们发现这种差异往往会随着时间的推移而持续存在甚至增加。这需要在动态环境中有效解决用户侧公平性的方法，然而这在文献中很少被探讨。然而，用于确保用户侧公平性（即减少性能差异）的典型方法——公平约束重新排名，在动态设定中面临两个基本挑战：（1）基于排名的公平约束的非可微性，阻碍了端到端训练范式；（2）时间效率低下，阻碍了对用户偏好变化的快速适应。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为FADE的端到端框架，通过微调策略动态减轻性能差异。为了解决上述挑战，FADE提出了一种 fine-tuning 策略。",
