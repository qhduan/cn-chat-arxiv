    "translated_abstract": "近似最近邻搜索（ANNS）在数据挖掘和人工智能领域中起着关键作用，涵盖了信息检索、计算机视觉、自然语言处理和推荐系统等各个学科。近年来，数据量急剧增加，穷举精确最近邻搜索的计算成本往往是禁止性的，必须采用近似技术。尽管图形化方法的平衡性能和召回率在ANNS算法中最近引起了广泛关注，但只有少数研究探索了利用GPU和多核处理器的强大计算能力，尽管广泛使用了大规模并行和通用计算能力。为了弥补这一差距，我们引入了一种基于并行计算硬件的新颖接近图和搜索算法。通过利用现代硬件的高性能能力，我们的方法实现了显著的效率提升。具体而言，我们的方法实现了高效的图构建和近似最近邻搜索。",
