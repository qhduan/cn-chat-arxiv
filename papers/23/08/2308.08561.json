    "translated_abstract": "药物研发的研究与开发(R&D)阶段是一个漫长而昂贵的过程。为了改革这个过程，我们引入了新概念QMLS，将整个R&D阶段缩短到三到六个月，成本仅为五到八万美元。对于命中产生，机器学习分子生成(MLMG)根据目标蛋白的分子结构生成可能的命中物，而量子模拟(QS)根据与目标蛋白的反应和结合效果过滤原始实验中的分子。然后，对于铅优化，从MLMG和QS生成和过滤的结果分子进行比较，并通过机器学习分子变异(MLMV)将那些出现在两个过程中的分子制成数十种分子变体，而其他分子只制成几种变体。最后，所有优化的分子将经过多轮高标准的QS过滤，以确保反应效果。",
    "tldr": "该论文介绍了一种名为QMLS的新概念，通过结合机器学习和量子模拟的方法，可以缩短药物研发的时间和降低成本。通过生成命中物和优化分子的过程，可以大大提高药物发现的效率。",
