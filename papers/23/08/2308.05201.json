    "translated_abstract": "随着通用生成式人工智能的出现，对其对劳动市场的影响的兴趣不断增加。为了填补现有的实证空白，我们将ChatGPT的推出解释为一种外生冲击，并采用差异法来量化其对在线劳动市场中与文本相关的工作和自由职业者的影响。我们的结果显示，直接接触ChatGPT的任务和自由职业者的交易量显著下降。此外，这种下降在相对较高的过去交易量或较低的质量标准下尤为显著。然而，并非所有服务提供商都普遍经历了负面影响。随后的分析表明，在这个转型期间，能够适应新进展并提供增强人工智能技术的服务的自由职业者可以获得可观的利益。因此，虽然ChatGPT的出现有可能替代人力劳动",
