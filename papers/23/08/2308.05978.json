    "translated_abstract": "互联网物联网(IoT)范例的扩展是不可避免的，但是对于IoT设备对恶意软件事件的脆弱性已成为一个越来越关注的问题。最近的研究显示，将强化学习与移动目标防御(MTD)机制相结合，可以增强IoT设备的网络安全性。然而，大量的新恶意软件攻击和代理人学习和选择有效的MTD技术所需的时间使得这种方法在现实世界的IoT场景中不切实际。为解决这个问题，本研究提出了CyberForce，一个采用联邦强化学习(FRL)的框架，用于集体且保密地确定适合缓解各种零日攻击的MTD技术。CyberForce结合了设备指纹识别和异常检测，通过奖励或惩罚FRL agent选择的MTD机制。该框架在一个由十台真实IoT平台设备组成的联邦中进行了评估。通过六个恶意软件样本进行了一系列实验。",
