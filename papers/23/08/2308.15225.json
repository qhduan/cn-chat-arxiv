    "abstract": "Over the past decades, cognitive neuroscientists and behavioral economists have recognized the value of describing the process of decision making in detail and modeling the emergence of decisions over time. For example, the time it takes to decide can reveal more about an agents true hidden preferences than only the decision itself.

Here, we argue that artificial intelligence (AI) research would benefit from a stronger focus on insights about how decisions emerge over time and incorporate related process data to improve AI predictions in general and human-AI interactions in particular.

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的几十年中，认知神经科学家和行为经济学家已经认识到详细描述决策过程和建立决策随时间演变的模型的价值。例如，决策所需的时间可以揭示一个个体真正的潜在偏好，而不仅仅是决策本身。类似地，追踪决策过程的数据，如眼动或神经记录，包含了关键的信息，即使没有达成决策也可以被利用。在这里，我们认为人工智能研究应更加关注决策如何随时间演变以及如何融入相关的过程数据来改善人工智能的预测，特别是在人与人工智能之间的交互中。首先，我们介绍了一个非常成熟的计算框架，该框架认为决策是从杂音累积的证据中产生的，并介绍了相关的心理学、神经科学和经济学的实证研究。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出利用决策过程数据和模型改善人工智能与人类之间的交互。通过详细描述决策过程和建立决策演变模型，可以揭示潜在的偏好，同时追踪决策过程的数据可以提供重要信息，从而改善人工智能的预测能力。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes the use of process data and models of decision-making to improve human-AI interactions. By describing the decision-making process in detail and modeling its evolution over time, hidden preferences can be revealed and important information can be extracted from process data to enhance AI predictions."
