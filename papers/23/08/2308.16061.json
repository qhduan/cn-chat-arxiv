    "translated_abstract": "勒索软件服务（RaaS）正在增加勒索软件攻击的规模和复杂性。了解RaaS背后的内部运作一直是个挑战，因为此类活动是非法的。最近Conti公司泄露的聊天记录给我们提供了一个了解这类组织内部运作的良机。本文使用自然语言处理（NLP）和潜在狄利克雷分配（LDA）等机器学习技术以及可视化策略，分析了Conti公司聊天记录中的主要主题讨论。发现了五个讨论主题：1）业务，2）技术，3）内部任务/管理，4）恶意软件，5）客户服务/问题解决。此外，Conti成员的主题分布显示，只有4%的人进行了专门的讨论，而几乎所有人（96%）都是全能型，意味着他们的讨论都围绕着这五个主题展开。",
