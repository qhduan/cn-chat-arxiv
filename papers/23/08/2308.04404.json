    "abstract": "These days with the rising computational capabilities of wireless user equipment such as smart phones, tablets, and vehicles, along with growing concerns about sharing private data, a novel machine learning model called federated learning (FL) has emerged. FL enables the separation of data acquisition and computation at the central unit, which is different from centralized learning that occurs in a data center. FL is typically used in a wireless edge network where communication resources are limited and unreliable. Bandwidth constraints necessitate scheduling only a subset of UEs for updates in each iteration, and because the wireless medium is shared, transmissions are susceptible to interference and are not assured. The article discusses the significance of Machine Learning in wireless communication and highlights Federated Learning (FL) as a novel approach that could play a vital role in future mobile networks, particularly 6G and beyond.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着智能手机、平板电脑和车辆等无线用户设备的计算能力不断提高，以及对共享私人数据的日益关注，一种名为联邦学习（FL）的新型机器学习模型已经出现。FL使得数据获取和计算在中央单元中分离，这与在数据中心中进行的集中式学习不同。FL通常用于无线边缘网络中，其中通信资源有限且不可靠。带宽限制要求在每次迭代中仅安排部分用户设备进行更新，并且由于无线介质是共享的，传输易受干扰且不保证。本文讨论了机器学习在无线通信中的重要性，并强调了联邦学习（FL）作为一种新颖方法，在未来的移动网络中特别是6G及以后扮演重要角色。",
