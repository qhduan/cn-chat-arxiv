    "translated_abstract": "无悔算法在学习两人零和标准型游戏和扩展型游戏的纳什均衡中很受欢迎。最近的许多研究考虑了最后一次迭代收敛的无悔算法。其中，最有名的两个算法是乐观梯度下降上升（OGDA）和乐观乘法权重更新（OMWU）。然而，OGDA的每次迭代复杂度很高。OMWU具有较低的每次迭代复杂度，但实验性能较差，并且它的收敛仅在纳什均衡唯一时成立。最近的研究提出了一种基于奖励转化（RT）框架用于MWU，它消除了唯一性条件，并且在与OMWU相同迭代次数的情况下实现了有竞争力的性能。不幸的是，基于RT的算法在相同迭代次数下表现不如OGDA，并且它们的收敛保证基于连续时间反馈假设，这在大多数情况下不成立。为了解决这些问题，我们对RT框架进行了更详细的分析。",
