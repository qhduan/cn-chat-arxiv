    "translated_abstract": "图论估计是网络分析中最基本的问题之一，在过去十年中受到了相当大的关注。从统计学的角度来看，高等提出了对于随机块模型（SBM）和非参数图论估计的图论估计的极小极差误差率。统计优化估计是基于约束最小二乘法，并且在维度上具有指数级的计算复杂度。从计算的角度来看，已知的最优多项式时间估计器是基于通用奇异值阈值（USVT），但是它只能达到比极小极差错误率慢得多的估计错误率。人们自然会想知道这样的差距是否是必要的。USVT的计算优化性或图论估计中的计算障碍的存在一直是一个长期存在的问题。在这项工作中，我们对此迈出了第一步，并为图论估计的计算障碍提供了严格的证据。",
