    "translated_abstract": "在社交媒体上，具有有害内容的在线文本是一种威胁，可能会引起网络骚扰。尽管许多平台采取了措施，例如基于机器学习的仇恨言论检测系统来减少其影响，但那些有害内容发布者仍然可以通过修改有害词汇的拼写来逃避系统。这些修改后的单词也称为人类编写的文本扰动。许多研究开发了一定的技术来生成对抗样本，以帮助机器学习模型获得识别这些扰动的能力。然而，机器生成的扰动与人类编写的扰动之间仍存在差距。在本文中，我们介绍了一个包含人类编写的在线扰动的基准测试集，用于毒性言论检测模型。我们还招募了一组工人来评估此测试集的质量并删除低质量的样本。同时，为了检查我们的扰动是否可以归一化为其干净版本，我们还创建了一个相关的测试集。",
