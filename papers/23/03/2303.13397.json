    "translated_abstract": "人体网格恢复（HMR）为各种实际应用提供了丰富的人体信息，例如游戏、人机交互和虚拟现实。与单一图像方法相比，基于视频的方法可以利用时间信息通过融合人体运动先验进一步提高性能。然而，像 VIBE 这样的多对多方法存在运动平滑性和时间一致性的挑战。而像 TCMR 和 MPS-Net 这样的多对一方法则依赖于未来帧，在推理过程中是非因果和时间效率低下的。为了解决这些挑战，提出了一种新的基于扩散驱动变压器的视频 HMR 框架（DDT）。DDT 旨在从输入序列中解码特定的运动模式，增强运动平滑性和时间一致性。作为一种多对多方法，DDT 的解码器输出所有帧的人体网格，使 DDT 更适用于时间效率至关重要的实际应用。",
