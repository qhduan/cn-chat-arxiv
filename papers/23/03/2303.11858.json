    "translated_abstract": "对知识图谱（KG）进行一阶逻辑（FOL）查询的回答仍然是一项具有挑战性的任务，主要是由于KG不完整性而导致的。查询嵌入方法通过计算实体、关系和逻辑查询的低维度向量表示来解决这个问题。KG表现出对称性和组合性等关系模式，建模这些模式可以进一步提高查询嵌入模型的性能。然而，这些模式在查询嵌入模型中的作用尚未在文献中进行研究。在本文中，我们填补了这一研究空白，并通过引入允许学习关系模式的归纳偏差，加强FOL查询推理的模式推理能力。为此，我们开发了一种新的查询嵌入方法RoConE，它将查询区域定义为几何锥体，并通过在复杂空间中旋转代数查询算子。RoConE结合了几何锥体作为可以明确定义查询表示的几何表示和旋转代数查询算子的优势。",
