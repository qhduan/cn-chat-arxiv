    "translated_abstract": "尽管几十年的理论研究已经发明了几个纠错码类别，但这些码的设计却是一项极具挑战性的任务，主要依靠人类智慧。最近的研究表明，这样的设计可以通过机器学习（ML）工具有效地自动化和加速，从而实现与经典设计相比具有良好性能增益的ML驱动的纠错码类别。然而，一个根本性的挑战是，对于大码维度来说，设计和训练完全的ML驱动的编码器和解码器对来说是非常复杂的，如果不是不可能的的话。在本文中，我们提出了Product Autoencoder（ProductAE）-一种计算效率高的深度学习驱动（编码器，解码器）对的系列-旨在通过可管理的训练复杂性实现相对较大的代码（编码器和解码器）的训练。我们借鉴了经典乘积码的思想，并提出了使用ProductAE构建大型神经网络的编码技术。",
