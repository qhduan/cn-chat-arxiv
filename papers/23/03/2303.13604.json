    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了组合多臂赌博机问题，其中包含了期望下的随机次模收益和全赌徒延迟反馈，延迟反馈被假定为组合和匿名。也就是说，延迟反馈是由过去行动的奖励组成的，这些奖励由子组件构成，其未知的分配方式。研究了三种延迟反馈模型：有界对抗模型、随机独立模型和随机条件独立模型，并针对每种延迟模型导出了后悔界。忽略问题相关参数，我们证明了所有延迟模型的后悔界为 $\\tilde{O}(T^{2/3} + T^{1/3} \\nu)$，其中 $T$ 是时间范围，$\\nu$ 是三种情况下不同定义的延迟参数，因此展示了带有延迟的补偿项。所考虑的算法被证明能够胜过其他考虑了延迟组合匿名反馈的全赌徒方法。",
