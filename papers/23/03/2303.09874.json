    "translated_abstract": "在20世纪50年代，霍勒斯巴洛和弗雷德阿特纳夫提出了感官系统和它们如何适应环境之间的关系：早期视觉的进化是为了最大限度地传递关于输入信号的信息。按照香农的定义，这些信息是通过自然场景中拍摄的图像的概率来描述的。由于计算能力的限制，以前无法直接准确地预测图像的概率。尽管这种想法的探索是间接的，主要基于图像密度的过度简化模型或系统设计方法，但这些方法在重现各种生理和心理物理现象方面取得了成功。在本文中，我们直接评估自然图像的概率，并分析它如何确定知觉灵敏度。我们使用与人类意见相关性很高的图像质量指标作为人类视觉的代理，以及一个先进的生成模型来直接估计自然图像的概率密度函数。我们的结果表明，根据Barlow和Attneave理论预测的图像统计与人类知觉之间存在系统性的关联。我们通过展示具有更丰富统计特征的自然图像被感知为具有更大的显着性来说明这一发现，这是通过视觉搜索实验测量的。我们的工作提供了直接支持Barlow和Attneave理论的证据，并建立了一个新的框架，用于理解图像统计与知觉之间的关系。",

    "en_tdlr": "The study evaluates the probability of natural images and analyzes its impact on human perception. By showing that natural images with richer statistics are perceived as having greater salience, the paper provides direct evidence in support of the Barlow and Attneave theory and establishes a new framework for understanding the link between image statistics and perception."
