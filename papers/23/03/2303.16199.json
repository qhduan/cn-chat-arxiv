    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了LLaMA-Adapter这一轻量级适应方法，用于将LLaMA高效地微调为一个指令跟随模型。利用52K个自我指导示范，LLaMA-Adapter仅在冻结的LLaMA 7B模型上引入了1.2M个可学习参数，并且在8个A100 GPU上仅耗时不到一个小时进行微调。具体而言，我们采用一组可学习的适应提示，并在较高的变压器层中将它们预置于输入文本令牌之前。然后，提出了一种零初始化注意力机制和零门控机制，该机制可以自适应地将新的指令提示注入LLaMA，并有效地保留了其预先训练的知识。通过高效训练，LLaMA-Adapter能够产生高质量的响应，与完全微调的7B参数的Alpaca相似。此外，我们的方法还可以简单地扩展到多模态输入，例如图像，用于图像相关的LLaMA，在ScienceQA上实现了更强的推理能力。我们在https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/LLaMA-Adapt发布了我们的代码。",

The proposed method introduces only a small number of learnable parameters and significantly reduces the fine-tuning time, producing high-quality responses comparable to fully fine-tuned models such as Alpaca. The approach can also be extended to multi-modal input and achieves superior reasoning capacity on ScienceQA."
