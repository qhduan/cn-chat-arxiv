    "translated_abstract": "偏见影响着越来越多掌控我们生活的算法。预测性警务系统错误地高估有色人种社区的犯罪率；招聘算法削弱了合格的女性候选人的机会；人脸识别软件难以识别黑皮肤的面部。算法偏见已经受到了重视，相比之下，算法中立性却基本被忽视了。算法中立性是我的研究主题。我提出了三个问题。算法中立性是什么？算法中立性是否可能？当我们考虑算法中立性时，我们可以从算法偏见中学到什么？为了具体回答这些问题，我选择了一个案例研究：搜索引擎。借鉴关于科学中立性的研究，我认为只有当搜索引擎的排名不受某些价值观的影响时，搜索引擎才是中立的，比如政治意识形态或搜索引擎运营商的经济利益。我认为搜索中立性是不可能的。",
