    "translated_abstract": "社交机器人科学寻求解决网络虚假信息最受争议的形式之一的知识和解决方案。然而，社交机器人研究受到普遍的偏见、夸大的结果和误解的困扰，这些都为歧义、不切实际的期望和看似无法调和的发现打下了基础。克服这些问题对于确保可靠的解决方案和重申科学方法的有效性至关重要。在这篇文章中，我们修订了社交机器人研究中的一些最新结果，强调和纠正了事实错误以及方法论和概念问题。更重要的是，我们揭开了普遍的误解，解决了有关如何讨论社交机器人研究的基本问题。我们的分析揭示了以严谨、公正和负责任的方式讨论虚假信息研究的必要性。本文通过确定并驳斥社交机器人研究的支持者和反对者常用的谬误论证，支持这种努力。",
