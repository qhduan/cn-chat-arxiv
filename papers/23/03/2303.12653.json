    "translated_abstract": "近年来，大规模天线阵列的波束成形被广泛应用于5G和即将推出的6G中，因此各种技术被利用来提高其性能，例如深度学习、高级优化算法等。尽管在许多具有深度学习的先前研究方案中其性能相当吸引人，但通常当环境或数据集发生变化时，其性能会迅速下降。因此，设计具有强大鲁棒性的有效波束成形网络是智能无线通信的一个开放问题。在本文中，我们提出了一个健壮的波束成形自监督网络，并在两种不同数据集和各种场景下进行了验证。仿真结果表明，所提出的具有混合学习的自监督网络在经典的DeepMIMO和新的WAIR-D数据集上具有强大的鲁棒性，适用于各种环境。此外，我们还提出了原理来解释这个翻译的合理性。",
