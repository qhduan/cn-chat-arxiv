    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种叫做拓扑点云聚类（TPCC）的新方法，它基于点云对于全局拓扑特征的贡献来聚类点。TPCC从谱聚类和拓扑数据分析中综合了有利的特征，基于考虑与所考虑的点云相关联的一个单形复合体的谱特性。由于它基于考虑稀疏特征向量计算，TPCC同样容易解释和实现，就像谱聚类一样。然而，通过不仅关注与从点云数据创建的图相关联的单个矩阵，而是关注与恰当构造的单形复合体相关联的整个Hodge-Laplacian的一整套矩阵，我们可以利用更丰富的拓扑特征来描述点云内的数据点，并受益于拓扑技术相对于噪声的相对健壮性。我们在合成和真实世界数据上测试了TPCC的性能。",
