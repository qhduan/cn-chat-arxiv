    "translated_abstract": "在粒子物理学中，模拟高分辨率探测器响应一直是一个存储成本高、计算密集的过程。尽管深度生成模型可以使这个过程更具成本效益，但超高分辨率探测器模拟仍然很困难，因为它包含了事件内相关和细粒度的相互信息。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了一种新颖的生成对抗网络方法（IEA-GAN），融合了自监督学习和关系推理模型。IEA-GAN提出了一个关系推理模块，近似于探测器模拟中“事件”的概念，可以生成与图层相关的上下文化的图像，提高了超高分辨率探测器响应的相关性和多样性。IEA-GAN还引入了新的事件感知损失和统一性损失，显著提高了图像的保真度和多样性。我们展示了IEA-GAN的应用。",
