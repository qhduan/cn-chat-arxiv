    "translated_abstract": "在公正选择问题中，基于代理人投票选取一个固定大小为$k$的代理人子集。如果没有代理人可以通过改变自己的投票来影响自己被选择的机会，则选择机制是公正的。如果对于每个实例，所选子集所接收的票数与获得最高票数的大小为$k$的子集所接收的票数的比率至少为$\\alpha$的一部分，则该机制是$\\alpha$-最优的。我们在一个更一般的设置中研究了带权力的确定性公正机制，并提供了首个逼近保证，大约为$1/\\lceil 2n/k\\rceil$。当要选择的代理人数量相对于总代理人数量足够大时，这比以前已知的无权重设置的逼近比率$1/k$有所改进。我们进一步证明了我们的机制可以适应公正分配问题，即在其中有多个集合需要选出代理人。",
