    "translated_abstract": "准确地预测不确定的电力产量对于电力市场的社会福利具有益处，可以减少平衡资源的需求。将这种预测描述为一项分析任务，当前文献提出了以分析市场作为激励手段来改善精度的数据共享方法，例如利用时空相关性。挑战在于，当相关数据用作预测的输入特征时，重叠信息的价值在于收入分配方面使市场设计复杂化，因为这种价值在本质上是组合的。我们为风力预测应用开发了一个考虑相关性的分析市场。为了分配收入，我们采用了基于Shapley值的归因策略，将代理人的特征视为玩家，将他们的相互作用视为一个特征函数博弈。我们说明了描述这种博弈的多种选项，每个选项都有因果细微差别，影响着特征相关时的市场行为。",
