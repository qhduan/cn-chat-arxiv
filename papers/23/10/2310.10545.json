    "translated_abstract": "通货紧缩变量旋转是一种重要的因子分析方法，旨在首先找到原始数据的低维表示，然后寻求旋转，使旋转后的低维表示具有科学意义。尽管Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by the varimax rotation被广泛应用于拟合因子分析，但由于varimax rotation需要在正交矩阵集合上解非凸优化问题，因此很难提供理论保证。本文提出了一种逐行求解正交矩阵的通货紧缩变量旋转过程。除了在计算上的优势和灵活性之外，我们还能在广泛的背景下对所提出的过程进行完全的理论保证。在PCA之后采用这种新的varimax方法作为第二步，我们进一步分析了这个两步过程在一个更一般的因子模型的情况下。",
