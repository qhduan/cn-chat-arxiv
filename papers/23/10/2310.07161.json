    "translated_abstract": "在VoIP（互联网语音传输协议）通信中，由声学转换引入的复杂性需要进行严格的分析。本研究基于对专有发送端降噪效果的探索，对Google Meets和Zoom等平台进行了细致评估。研究利用Deep Noise Suppression（DNS）2020数据集，确保了针对各种降噪设置和接收器接口的结构化考察。通过将Oaxaca分解引入到声学-语音扰动分析中，本研究引入了一种方法论的创新，该分解通常是经济计量学工具，在此处重新用于分析VoIP系统中的声学-语音扰动。为了进一步确定这些转换的影响，利用心理声学指标，特别是PESQ和STOI，来提供对语音改变的全面理解。总体而言，所获得的观点突出显示了VoIP影响的声学动力学的复杂景观。",
