    "translated_abstract": "自动语音识别（ASR）的质量通常通过字错率（WER）来衡量。WER估计是一项任务，旨在预测ASR系统的WER，给定一个语音说话和一个转录。在大量数据上训练先进的ASR系统的同时，这个任务越来越受到关注。在这种情况下，WER估计在许多场景中变得必要，例如选择具有未知转录质量的训练数据，或在没有地面真实转录的情况下估计ASR系统的测试性能。面对大量数据，WER估计仪的运算效率在实际应用中变得至关重要。然而，以前的研究通常未将其视为优先考虑的问题。本文介绍了一种使用自监督学习表示法（SSLR）的快速WER估计器（Fe-WER）。该估计器基于通过平均池聚合的SSLR构建。结果表明，相对于e-WER3基线，Fe-WER的性能提高了19.69％。",
