    "translated_abstract": "数据是机器学习的动力 - 丰富和高质量的训练数据对于机器学习的成功至关重要。然而，要将机器学习从少数大型公司之间的竞赛转变为为众多普通用户的数据分析请求服务的可访问技术，仍然存在重要的挑战。我们观察到的一个差距是，许多机器学习用户可以从其他数据所有者拥有的新数据中受益，而这些数据所有者却坐在一堆数据上，不知道谁可以受益于它。这种差距为构建一个能够自动连接供求的在线市场创造了机会。虽然在线匹配市场很常见（例如，打车系统），但为机器学习设计一个以数据为中心的市场面临许多前所未有的挑战。本文开发了新的技术来解决设计这样一个市场中的两个核心挑战：（a）为了高效地将需求与供应匹配，我们设计了一种算法，可以从数千个数据池中自动发现任何机器学习任务所需的有用数据。",
