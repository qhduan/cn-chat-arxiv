    "translated_abstract": "当领域知识有限且实验受到道德、财务或时间限制时，从业者会转向观察性因果发现方法来恢复因果结构，利用其数据的统计特性。由于没有进一步的假设，因果发现是一个不适定的问题，每个算法都有其自己的一套通常无法验证的假设，其中一些在真实数据集中很难满足。鉴于这些考虑，本文在不同背景条件下对最近的因果发现方法在观察性独立同分布数据上的实际性能进行了广泛的基准测试，允许违反每个选定方法所需的关键假设。我们的实验结果显示，在这些具有挑战性场景中，基于score matching的方法在推断的图的误报与漏报率方面表现出令人惊讶的性能，并提供了对其的理论洞察。",
