    "translated_abstract": "在社交媒体平台上广泛分享的伪造内容是一个重大社会问题，要求加强监管并给研究社区带来新的挑战。近年来，超真实的深度伪造视频的普及引起了对音频和视觉伪造威胁的关注。大多数关于检测AI生成的伪造视频的先前工作只利用了视觉模态或音频模态。虽然文献中有一些方法利用音频和视觉模态来检测伪造视频，但它们尚未在涉及声学和视觉操作的多模态深度伪造视频数据集上进行全面评估。此外，这些现有方法大多基于CNN，并且检测准确率较低。受到Transformer在各个领域的最新成功启发，为了解决深度伪造技术带来的挑战，本文提出了一种考虑声学操作的音频-视觉Transformer集成网络（AVTENet）框架。",
