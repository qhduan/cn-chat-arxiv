This Perspective maps out principles and methods for using generative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models (LLMs), to elevate the quality and efficiency of academic writing. We introduce a human-AI collaborative framework that delineates the rationale (why), process (how), and nature (what) of AI engagement in writing. The framework pinpoints both short-term and long-term reasons for engagement and their underlying mechanisms (e.g., cognitive offloading and imaginative stimulation). It reveals the role of AI throughout the writing process, conceptualized through a two-stage model for human-AI collaborative writing, and the nature of AI assistance in writing, represented through a model of writing-assistance types and levels. Building on this framework, we describe effective prompting techniques for incorporating AI into the writing routine (outlining, drafting, and editing) a",

    "translated_abstract": "学术写作是研究项目中不可或缺但费时费力的部分。本文介绍了使用生成型人工智能（AI）特别是大型语言模型（LLMs）提高学术写作质量和效率的原则和方法。我们提出了一个人机协作框架，详细阐述了AI在写作中的理论基础（为什么）、过程（如何）和性质（什么）。该框架指出了短期和长期参与AI写作的原因及其基本机制（如认知卸载和想象刺激）。它揭示了AI在整个写作过程中的作用，通过一个人机协作写作的两阶段模型和写作辅助类型和级别的模型表示了AI在写作中的帮助方式。基于该框架，我们描述了在写作常规中整合AI的有效提示技术（大纲、起草和编辑）。",
