    "translated_abstract": "在网络安全的机器学习领域，传统工作流依赖于高质量标记数据和手动特征工程，但有限的数据集和人类专业知识阻碍了特征选择，导致模型难以捕捉关键关系和有效泛化。受到GPT-4和Vision Transformers等机器学习应用领域的最新进展的启发，我们开发了netFound，一个网络安全的基础模型。该模型利用自我监督算法对现有的未标记网络数据包进行预训练。netFound的设计融合了网络流量的层次化和多模态属性，有效捕捉了隐藏的网络上下文，包括应用逻辑、通信协议和网络条件。有了这个预训练基础，即使处理质量低、有限和嘈杂的标记数据，我们也可以对netFound进行微调，适用于各种下游任务。我们的实验证明了netFound的效果。",
