    "translated_abstract": "随着使用答案集编程的工业应用增加，对形式验证工具，特别是对关键应用的需求也增加了。在程序优化过程中，希望有一种工具可以自动验证优化的子程序是否可以替代原始子程序。从形式上讲，这对应于验证两个程序的强等价性的问题。为了做到这一点，开发了翻译工具anthem。它可以与用于经典逻辑的自动定理证明器一起使用，以验证两个程序是否强等价。在当前版本的anthem中，只能验证具有受限输入语言的正程序的强等价性。这是anthem中实现的翻译τ*的结果，它生成了here-and-there逻辑中的公式，该逻辑只对正程序与经典逻辑相一致。这篇论文扩展了anthem，以便可以验证更广泛的高级逻辑程序的强等价性。",
