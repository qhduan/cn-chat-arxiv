    "translated_abstract": "在自动驾驶中预测车辆运动需要对车辆间的相互作用有深入的理解，并保持在欧几里得几何变换下的运动等变性。传统模型往往缺乏处理自动驾驶车辆中复杂动力学和场景中各主体之间交互关系所需的复杂性。因此，这些模型具有较低的模型容量，导致更高的预测误差和较低的训练效率。在我们的研究中，我们使用EqMotion，一个领先的等变粒子和人类预测模型，该模型还考虑到不变的主体间相互作用，用于多代理车辆运动预测任务。此外，我们使用多模式预测机制以概率化方式考虑多个可能的未来路径。通过利用EqMotion，我们的模型在参数更少（120万）和训练时间显著缩短（少于..）的情况下实现了业界最先进的性能。",
