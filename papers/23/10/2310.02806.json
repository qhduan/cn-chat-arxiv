    "translated_abstract": "根区土壤湿度的监测对于精密农业、智能灌溉和干旱预防至关重要。通常通过求解Richards方程这样的水文模型来模拟土壤的时空水流动力学。在本文中，我们提出了一种新型的基于数据的Richards方程数值解法。这种数值解法被称为D-GRW（Data-facilitated global Random Walk）方法，它在有限体积离散化框架中协同地整合了自适应线性化方案、神经网络和全局随机游走，可以在合理的假设下产生精确的Richards方程数值解，并且具有收敛性保证。通过三个示例，我们展示和讨论了我们的D-GRW方法在精度和质量守恒性能方面的卓越表现，并将其与基准数值解法和商用软件进行了比较。",
