    "translated_abstract": "可转移的对抗性示例在现实世界的黑盒攻击场景中引发了关键的安全问题。然而，在这项工作中，我们发现了常见评估实践中的两个主要问题：(1) 对于攻击的可转移性，缺乏系统化的，一对一的攻击比较和公平的超参数设置。(2) 对于攻击的隐蔽性，简单地没有比较。为了解决这些问题，我们通过(1) 提出一种新的攻击分类策略，并在可转移性方面进行系统化和公平的同类别分析，以及(2) 从攻击回溯的角度考虑多样的难以察觉的度量和更细粒度的隐蔽特性来建立新的评估指南。为此，我们对ImageNet上的可转移的对抗性示例进行了首次大规模评估，涉及对9种代表性防御的23种代表性攻击。我们的评估提供了一些新的见解，包括挑战共识的见解。",
