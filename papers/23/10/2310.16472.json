    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了半环溯源——一种最初在关系数据库环境中定义的成功框架，用于描述逻辑。在此上下文中，本体公理被用交换半环的元素进行注释，并且这些注释根据它们的推导方式传播到本体的结果中。我们定义了一种溯源语义，适用于包括几种轻量级描述逻辑的语言，并展示了它与为带有特定类型注释（如模糊度）的本体定义的其他语义之间的关系。我们证明了在一些对半环施加限制的情况下，语义满足一些期望的特性（如扩展了数据库中定义的半环溯源）。然后我们专注于著名的why溯源方法，它允许计算每个加法幂等和乘法幂等的交换半环的半环溯源，并研究了与这种溯源方法相关的问题的复杂性。",
