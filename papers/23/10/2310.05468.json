    "translated_abstract": "异常检测是一种重要的无监督机器学习任务，涉及在复杂数据集和系统中识别异常行为。虽然机器学习算法和决策支持系统（DSS）提供了有效的解决方案，但仅仅定位异常往往在实际应用中不足。这些系统的用户通常需要了解预测背后的原因，以便进行根本原因分析并增强对模型的信任。然而，由于异常检测的无监督性质，创建可解释的工具是具有挑战性的。本文介绍了EIF+，这是扩展孤立森林（EIF）的增强变体，旨在增强泛化能力。此外，我们提出了ExIFFI，一种将扩展孤立森林与解释性功能（特征排名）相结合的新方法。实验结果提供了以孤立基于方法进行异常检测的综合比较分析。",
