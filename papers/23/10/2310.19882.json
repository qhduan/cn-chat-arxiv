    "translated_abstract": "尽管量子状态重构非常困难，但对于实际应用中的重构者来说，大多数状态的兴趣不大。鉴于自然界中出现的状态和酉算符都具有有界的门复杂度，自然而然地想问是否可以实现高效的学习。在这项工作中，我们证明了为了将由$G$个两量子比特门生成的状态学习到小的迹距离，需要和充分的样本复杂度与$G$线性比例。我们还证明了学习由$G$个门生成的酉算符到小的平均误差的最优查询复杂度与$G$线性比例。虽然可以实现样本高效的学习，但我们展示了在合理的密码学猜想下，学习门复杂度为$G$的状态和酉算符的计算复杂度必须与$G$指数比例。我们阐明了这些结果如何确定了量子机器学习模型的表达能力的基本限制，并提供了对无免费午餐定理的新视角。",
