    "translated_abstract": "最近，云根本原因分析中的大型语言模型（LLM）应用受到了积极的关注。然而，当前方法仍然依赖于手动工作流设置，并没有充分发挥LLMs的决策和环境交互能力。我们提出了RCAgent，这是一个实用和注重隐私的工具增强LLM自主代理框架，用于实际的工业RCA使用。RCAgent在内部部署的模型上运行，而不是GPT系列，能够进行自由格式的数据收集和全面的分析，并结合各种增强功能，包括独特的行动轨迹自一致性和一套用于上下文管理、稳定化和导入领域知识的方法。我们的实验证明RCAgent在RCA的各个方面（预测根本原因、解决方案、证据和责任）以及当前规则未涵盖的任务上都明显优于ReAct，得到了自动化和人工验证的确认。",
