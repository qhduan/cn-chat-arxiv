    "abstract": "Across a wide array of disciplines, many researchers use machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify a subgroup of individuals, called exceptional responders, who are likely to be helped by a treatment the most. A common approach consists of two steps. One first estimates the conditional average treatment effect or its proxy using an ML algorithm. They then determine the cutoff of the resulting treatment prioritization score to select those predicted to benefit most from the treatment. Unfortunately, these estimated treatment prioritization scores are often biased and noisy. Furthermore, utilizing the same data to both choose a cutoff value and estimate the average treatment effect among the selected individuals suffer from a multiple testing problem. To address these challenges, we develop a uniform confidence band for experimentally evaluating the sorted average treatment effect (GATES) among the individuals whose treatment prioritization score is at least as high as any given quant",

    "translated_abstract": "在广泛的学科领域中，许多研究人员使用机器学习算法来识别一组被称为例外反应者的个体，他们最有可能从治疗中获益。一个常见的方法包括两个步骤。首先使用机器学习算法估计条件平均治疗效果或其代理。然后确定所得治疗优先顺序分数的截断值，以选择那些最有可能从治疗中获益的人。不幸的是，这些估计的治疗优先顺序分数往往存在偏差和噪声。此外，利用相同的数据既选择截断值又估计所选个体的平均治疗效果会遇到多重测试问题。为了解决这些挑战，我们开发了一个统一的置信带来实验性地评估那些治疗优先顺序分数至少与任何给定量化值相等的个体的排序平均治疗效果（GATES）。",

It proposes a uniform confidence band method to evaluate the average treatment effect among these individuals, taking into account the challenge of multiple testing when estimating treatment effects and determining cutoff values."
