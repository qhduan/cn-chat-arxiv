    "translated_abstract": "人类每天都感知物体，并通过各种渠道传达他们的感知。在这里，我们描述了一个计算模型，追踪和模拟物体的感知以及它们在交流中所传达的表示。我们描述了我们内部表示的两个关键组成部分（\"观察到的\"和\"看到的\"），并将它们与熟悉的计算机视觉概念（编码和解码）相关联。这些元素被合并在一起形成符号网络，模拟了物体感知和人类交流中的意识。如今，大多数神经网络都是不可解释的。另一方面，我们的模型克服了这个限制。实验证明了该模型的可见性。我们人的物体感知模型使我们能够通过网络定义物体感知。我们通过构建一个包括基准分类器和额外层的新网络来演示这一点。这个层产生了图像的感知。",
