    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-speech have made it possible to generate natural-sounding audio from text. However, audiobook narrations involve dramatic vocalizations and intonations by the reader, with greater reliance on emotions, dialogues, and descriptions in the narrative. Using our dataset of 93 aligned book-audiobook pairs, we present improved models for prosody prediction properties (pitch, volume, and rate of speech) from narrative text using language modeling. Our predicted prosody attributes correlate much better with human audiobook readings than results from a state-of-the-art commercial TTS system: our predicted pitch shows a higher correlation with human reading for 22 out of the 24 books, while our predicted volume attribute proves more similar to human reading for 23 out of the 24 books. Finally, we present a human evaluation study to quantify the extent that people prefer prosody-enhanced audiobook readings over commercial text-to-speech systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近在文本转语音方面取得了一些进展，使得从文本中生成自然音效的音频成为可能。然而，有声书朗读涉及到读者的戏剧性声音和语调，更多地依赖情感、对话和叙述。使用我们的数据集，包括93本书与其对应的有声书，我们提出了改进的模型，用于从叙述文本中预测韵律属性（音高、音量和语速），并使用语言建模。我们预测的韵律属性与人类朗读的相关性要远高于商业级TTS系统的结果：在24本书中，我们预测的音高对22本书的人类阅读更具相关性，而我们预测的音量属性对23本书的人类阅读更加相似。最后，我们进行了一项人类评估研究，以量化人们更喜欢韵律增强的有声书朗读还是商业级文本转语音系统。",
