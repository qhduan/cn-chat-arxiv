    "translated_abstract": "本文针对图匹配问题进行研究，该问题包括在两个输入图之间找到最佳对齐，并在计算机视觉、网络去匿名化和蛋白质对齐等领域有许多应用。解决这个问题的常见方法是通过对NP难问题“二次分配问题”（QAP）进行凸松弛。本文引入了一种新的凸松弛方法，即对单位单纯形进行松弛，并开发了一种具有闭合迭代形式的高效镜像下降方案来解决该问题。在相关高斯Wigner模型下，我们证明了单纯形松弛法在高概率下具有唯一解。在无噪声情况下，这被证明可以精确恢复地面真实排列。此外，我们建立了一种新的输入矩阵假设条件，用于标准贪心取整方法，并且这个条件比常用的“对角线优势”条件更宽松。我们使用这个条件证明了地面真实排列的精确一步恢复。",
