    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）通过将机器学习（ML）训练分布在许多边缘设备上，以减少数据传输开销和保护数据隐私。由于FL模型训练可能涉及数百万个设备，因此需要大量资源，因此之前的工作一直致力于提高其资源效率以优化时间至准确性。然而，之前的工作通常将所有资源视为相同，而实际上它们可能产生大不相同的成本，这反而激发了优化成本至准确性的动机。为了解决这个问题，我们设计了CEFL，它使用自适应的成本感知客户选择策略，在训练FL模型时优化任意成本度量。我们的策略扩展并结合了基于效用的客户选择和关键学习期的先前工作，使其具有成本感知性。我们通过设计碳高效的FL来演示CEFL，在这里能源的碳强度是成本，并且显示它可以将碳排放减少93％，并将训练时间减少50％，与随机客户相比。",
