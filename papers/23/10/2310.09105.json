    "abstract": "We propose a regression-based approach to estimate how individuals' expectations influence their responses to a counterfactual change. We provide conditions under which average partial effects based on regression estimates recover structural effects. We propose a practical three-step estimation method that relies on subjective beliefs data. We illustrate our approach in a model of consumption and saving, focusing on the impact of an income tax that not only changes current income but also affects beliefs about future income. By applying our approach to survey data from Italy, we find that considering individuals' beliefs matter for evaluating the impact of tax policies on consumption decisions.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于回归的方法，用于估计个体的期望如何影响他们对对立情况的反应。我们提供了基于回归估计的平均偏效应恢复结构效应的条件。我们提出了一个依赖于主观信念数据的实用的三步估计方法。我们在一个消费和储蓄模型中说明了我们的方法，重点关注不仅改变当前收入而且影响对未来收入的信念的所得税的影响。通过将我们的方法应用于意大利的调查数据，我们发现考虑个体的信念对评估税收政策对消费决策的影响很重要。",
