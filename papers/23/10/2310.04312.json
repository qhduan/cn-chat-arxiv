    "title": "Bespoke scapegoats: Scientific advisory bodies and blame avoidance in the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond. (arXiv:2310.04312v1 [econ.GN])",
    "abstract": "Scholars have not asked why so many governments created ad hoc scientific advisory bodies (ahSABs) to address the Covid-19 pandemic instead of relying on existing public health infrastructure. We address this neglected question with an exploratory study of the US, UK, Sweden, Italy, Poland, and Uganda. Drawing on our case studies and the blame-avoidance literature, we find that ahSABs are created to excuse unpopular policies and take the blame should things go wrong. Thus, membership typically represents a narrow range of perspectives. An ahSAB is a good scapegoat because it does little to reduce government discretion and has limited ability to deflect blame back to government. Our explanation of our deviant case of Sweden, that did not create and ahSAB, reinforces our general principles. We draw the policy inference that ahSAB membership should be vetted by the legislature to ensure broad membership.",

    "translated_abstract": "学者们没有探究为什么这么多政府在应对新冠疫情时创建了临时科学咨询机构（ahSABs）而不依赖现有的公共卫生基础设施。我们通过对美国、英国、瑞典、意大利、波兰和乌干达的案例研究以及对推卸责任文献的借鉴，回答了这个被忽视的问题。我们发现，ahSABs的创建是为了为不受欢迎的政策开脱责任，事情出问题时成为替罪羊。因此，ahSABs的成员通常代表了一个狭窄的观点范围。ahSABs是一个好的替罪羊，因为它对减少政府的自由裁量权几乎没有帮助，并且在转嫁责任给政府方面能力有限。我们对瑞典没有创建ahSABs的异常案例的解释进一步证实了我们的一般原则。我们得出的政策推论是，应该通过立法机构对ahSABs成员进行审核，以确保广泛的成员代表性。",

The membership of ahSABs often represents a narrow range of perspectives. The case study of Sweden, which did not create ahSABs, further supports this principle. The policy recommendation is to vet ahSAB membership through the legislature to ensure broad representation."
