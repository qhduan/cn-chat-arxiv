    "translated_abstract": "期望改进（EI）可以说是贝叶斯优化中最流行的获得函数，并且已经在很多成功的应用中得到了应用。但是，EI的性能往往被一些新方法超越。尤其是，EI及其变种在并行和多目标设置中很难进行优化，因为它们的获得值在许多区域中数值上变为零。当观测次数增加、搜索空间的维度增加或约束条件的数量增加时，这种困难通常会增加，导致性能在文献中不一致且大多数情况下亚优化。在本论文中，我们提出了LogEI，这是一类新的采样函数。与标准EI相比，这些LogEI函数的成员要么具有相同的最优解，要么具有近似相等的最优解，但数值上更容易进行优化。我们证明了数值病态在“经典”分析EI、期望超体积改进（EHVI）以及它们的...",
