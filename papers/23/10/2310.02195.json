The proposed algorithm is compared against an exact method, a greedy heuristic and a metaheuristic. We experimentally show, using theoretical and real instances on a model representing a real manufacturing plant, that this algorithm either outperforms the other algorithms or gets an equally good solution in less computing time.",
