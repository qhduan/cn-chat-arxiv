    "translated_abstract": "由于其高效计算和竞争性的泛化能力，在线非参数估计器越来越受欢迎。一个重要的例子是随机梯度下降的变体。这些算法通常一次只取一个样本点，并立即更新感兴趣的参数估计。在这项工作中，我们考虑了这些在线算法的模型选择和超参数调整。我们提出了一种加权滚动验证过程，一种在线的留一交叉验证变体，对于许多典型的随机梯度下降估计器来说，额外的计算成本最小。类似于批量交叉验证，它可以提升基本估计器的自适应收敛速度。我们的理论分析很简单，主要依赖于一些一般的统计稳定性假设。模拟研究强调了滚动验证中发散权重在实践中的重要性，并证明了即使只有一个很小的偏差，它的敏感性也很高",
