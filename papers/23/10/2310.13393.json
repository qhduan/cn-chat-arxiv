    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在具有有限数目臂的多臂赌博机中以不断变化的形式进行最优臂识别。每个臂产生的离散时间数据形成了一个取值在共同、有限状态空间中的同质马尔可夫链。每个臂的状态转移由一个遵循单参数指数族的转移概率矩阵（TPM）捕获。每个臂的TPM的实值参数是未知的，属于给定空间。给定在臂的共同状态空间上定义的函数f，目标是在样本数最少的情况下识别最优臂，即在该臂的稳态分布下评估f的平均值最大的臂，同时满足对决策错误概率（即固定置信度区间）的上界。在渐进性的误差概率趋于零的情况下，建立了期望停止时间增长率的下界。此外，我们提出了一种最优臂识别策略。",
