    "translated_abstract": "在分散式合作的多臂赌博机中，每个代理观察到不同的奖励流，试图与其他代理交换信息以选择一系列手臂以最小化遗憾。与独立运行上界置信度（UCB）等多臂赌博机方法相比，协作场景中的代理可以表现得更好。本文研究了如何在未知比例的代理可能是拜占庭（即，以奖励均值估计或置信度集的形式传递任意错误信息）时恢复此类突出行为。该框架可用于模拟计算机网络中的攻击者，向推荐系统中插入攻击性内容的策划者，或者金融市场的操纵者。我们的主要贡献是开发了一种完全分散的具有容错上界置信度（UCB）算法，该算法将代理间的信息混合步骤与不一致和极端值的截断相结合。这个截断步骤使我们能够建立",
