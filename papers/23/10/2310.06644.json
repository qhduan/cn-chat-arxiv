    "translated_abstract": "神经形状表示通常指使用神经网络来表示3D几何，例如，在特定空间位置计算有符号距离或占据值。本文提出了一种新颖的编码器-解码器神经网络，用于在单次前向传递中嵌入3D形状。我们的架构基于多尺度混合系统，包括基于图形和基于体素的组件，以及连续可微的解码器。此外，该网络经过训练以解决Eikonal方程，仅需要零水平集的知识进行训练和推断。这意味着，与大多数之前的工作相比，我们的网络能够输出有效的有符号距离场，而无需明确的非零距离值或形状占据的先验知识。我们还提出了一种损失函数的修改，以解决曲面法线不存在的情况，例如，非封闭曲面和非流形几何的上下文。总体上，这可以帮助减少必要的先验知识。",
