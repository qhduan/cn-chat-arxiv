    "translated_abstract": "近期，生成式AI应用通过创建多样化且高质量的AI生成内容（AIGC）来满足广大用户群体的需求。随着移动设备的普及和移动流量的快速增长，通过无线通信网络提供对高质量AIGC服务的无处不在的访问已成为AIGC产品的未来方向。然而，在不稳定的信道、有限的带宽资源和分布不均匀的计算资源的无线网络中提供最优的AIGC服务是具有挑战性的。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一个由语义通信（SemCom）增强的AIGC（SemAIGC）生成和传输框架，其中只需提取和传输内容的语义信息而不是所有的二进制位。具体而言，SemAIGC在语义编码器和解码器中集成了基于扩散的模型，以实现高效的内容生成和灵活调整计算工作负载的目的。",
