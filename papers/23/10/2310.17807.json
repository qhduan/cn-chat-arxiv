    "translated_abstract": "在软件开发中，使用大型语言模型进行代码生成是一个快速增长的趋势。然而，如果没有有效的方法来确保生成的代码的正确性，这个趋势可能会导致许多不良结果。在本文中，我们提出了一个解决这个挑战的愿景：Clover范式，即闭环可验证代码生成，它将正确性检查简化为更可访问的一致性检查问题。在Clover的核心是一个检查器，它在代码、docstrings和形式注释之间进行一致性检查。该检查器使用了形式验证工具和大型语言模型的新颖集成实现。我们提供了理论分析来支持我们的论点，即Clover在一致性检查方面应该是有效的。我们还在一个由手工设计的数据集（CloverBench）上进行了实证调查，该数据集包含了注释的Dafny程序，难度水平与教科书相当。实验结果显示",
