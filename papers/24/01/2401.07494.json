    "translated_abstract": "计算效率和对抗鲁棒性是真实世界工程应用中的关键因素。然而，传统的神经网络往往在同时或分别解决这两个问题方面存在不足。通过从自然物理系统和现有文献中获取的见解，已知输入凸性结构增强了计算效率，而Lipschitz约束结构增强了对抗鲁棒性。通过利用凸性和Lipschitz连续性的优点，我们开发了一种新的网络结构，称为输入凸性Lipschitz循环神经网络。该模型在计算效率和对抗鲁棒性方面表现优于现有的循环单元，适用于一系列工程任务，包括基准MNIST图像分类、新加坡LHT Holdings公司的实际太阳能光伏系统规划中的实时太阳辐射预测，以及化学反应器的实时模型预测控制优化等。",
