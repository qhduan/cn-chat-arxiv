    "translated_abstract": "最近，像ChatGPT这样的大型语言模型展示了在解决一般任务方面的出色能力，展示了在推荐系统中应用的潜力。为了评估大型语言模型在推荐任务中的有效性，我们的研究主要集中在通过提示工程将大型语言模型用作推荐系统。我们提出了一个通用的框架，用于利用大型语言模型在推荐任务中的能力。为了进行分析，我们将大型语言模型的输入形式化为具有两个关键方面的自然语言提示，并解释了我们的框架如何推广到各种推荐场景。至于将大型语言模型用作推荐系统，我们根据大型语言模型的分类分析了公开可用性、调优策略、模型架构、参数规模和上下文长度对推荐结果的影响。至于提示工程，我们进一步分析了四个重要组成部分的影响。",
