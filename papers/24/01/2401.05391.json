    "translated_abstract": "基于Transformer的大型语言模型（LLM）在许多领域广泛应用，LLM推理的效率成为实际应用中的热门话题。然而，LLM通常在模型结构上设计复杂，具有大量操作，并以自回归模式进行推理，这使得设计一个高效的系统成为一项具有挑战性的任务。在本文中，我们提出了一种高效的LLM推理解决方案，具有低延迟和高吞吐量。首先，我们通过融合数据移动和逐元素操作简化了LLM解码层，以减少内存访问频率并降低系统延迟。我们还提出了一种分段KV缓存策略，将请求和响应令牌的键/值分别保存在不同的物理内存中，以实现有效的设备内存管理，有助于增大运行时批处理大小并提高系统吞吐量。我们设计了一个定制的Scaled-Dot-Product-Attention内核，以匹配我们的融合策略，基于分段KV缓存解决方案。我们实验证明，该解决方案在Intel GPU上实现了高效的LLM推理。",
