In this study, we extend MOT by incorporating causality constraints among assets, inspired by the nonanticipativity condition of stochastic processes.

The primal attainment and strong duality of McCormick MOT are established under standard assumptions. Empirically, McCormick MOT demonstrates the capability to narrow price bounds, achieving an average reduction of 1% or 4%. The degree of improvement depends on the payoffs of the options and the liquidity of the relevant vanilla options.",

    "translated_abstract": "马丁格尔最佳传输（MOT）通常为期权提供广泛的价格界限，限制了它们的实际适用性。在本研究中，我们通过引入资产之间的因果约束，扩展了MOT，灵感来自随机过程的非预期性条件。然而，这引入了一个计算上具有挑战性的双线性规划。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了麦科密克松松弛来缓解双因果形式，并将其称为麦科密克松MOT。在标准假设下，建立了麦科密克松MOT的原始实现和强对偶性。实证结果显示，麦科密克松MOT能够缩小价格界限，平均降低了1％或4％。改善程度取决于期权的回报和相关香草期权的流动性。",
