    "translated_abstract": "预测金融收益的波动性和分位数对于准确测量金融尾部风险，如风险价值和预期损失至关重要。这些预测中的关键要素包括理解金融收益的分布并准确估计波动性。本文引入了传统随机波动性模型的一种改进，称为实现随机波动性模型，它将实现波动性作为波动性的精确估计器。为了捕捉收益分布的众所周知的特征，即偏度和重尾巴，我们采用了三种类型的偏t分布。其中两种分布具有偏态正常特征，在建模收益分布方面提供了更大的灵活性。我们采用贝叶斯估计方法和马尔科夫链蒙特卡罗方法，对主要股指进行了应用。我们的实证分析利用了美国和日本股指数据，结果表明实现随机波动性模型相对于传统随机波动性模型在波动性和分位数预测上更具优势。",
