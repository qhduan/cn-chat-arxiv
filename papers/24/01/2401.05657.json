    "abstract": "In the context of social choice theory with ordinal preferences, we say that the defensible set is the set of alternatives $x$ such that for any alternative $y$, if $y$ beats $x$ in a head-to-head majority comparison, then there is an alternative $z$ that beats $y$ in a head-to-head majority comparison by a margin at least as large as the margin by which $y$ beat $x$. We show that any ordinal voting method satisfying two well-known axioms from voting theory--positive involvement and the Condorcet winner criterion--refines the defensible set. Using this lemma, we prove an impossibility theorem: there is no such voting method that also satisfies the Condorcet loser criterion, resolvability, and a common invariance property for Condorcet methods, namely that the choice of winners depends only on the relative sizes of majority margins.",

    "translated_abstract": "在具有序偏好的社会选择理论背景下，我们称可防御集合为那些对于任何替代方案$x$，如果$y$在两两对比中击败$x$，则存在一个替代方案$z$，它在两两对比中以至少与$y$击败$x$的间隔一样大的间隔击败$y$。我们证明了满足两个已知公理（正参与度和康多塞获胜者准则）的序次投票方法会完善可防御集合。利用这个引理，我们证明了一个不可能定理：没有一种同时还满足康多塞输掉者准则、可解性和康多塞方法的普遍不变性属性，即决胜者的选择只取决于多数边际的相对大小的投票方法。",
