In this study, we analyze how this scientific data documentation meets the needs of the ML community and regulatory bodies for its use in ML technologies. We examine a sample of 4041 data papers of different domains, assessing their completeness and coverage of the requested dimensions, and trends in recent years, putting special emphasis on the most and least documented dimensions.

    "translated_abstract": "为了确保机器学习系统的公平性和可信性，最近的立法举措和机器学习社区的相关研究指出需要记录用于训练机器学习模型的数据。此外，为了实现可重复性，许多科学领域的数据共享实践近年来也有了发展。在这个意义上，学术机构采用了这些实践，鼓励研究人员将他们的数据和技术文件发布在同行评议的出版物上，如数据论文。本研究分析了科学数据文档如何满足机器学习社区和监管机构对其在机器学习技术中使用的需求。我们对4041篇不同领域的数据论文样本进行了评估，评估其完整性和覆盖范围，并研究了近年来的趋势，特别关注了最多和最少被记录的方面。作为结果，我们提出了一套数据创建者的建议指南。",
