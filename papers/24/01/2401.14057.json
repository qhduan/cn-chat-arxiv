We aimed to achieve hemispheric specialisation similar to what is observed in humans across different tasks; the dominant system (usually the right hand, left hemisphere) excels at tasks involving coordination and efficiency of movement, and the non-dominant system performs better at tasks requiring positional stability. Specialisation was achieved by training the hemispheres with different loss functions tailored toward the expected behaviour of the respective hemispheres. We compared bilateral models with and without specialised hemispheres, with and without inter-hemispheric connectivity (representing the biological Corpus Callosum), and unilateral models with and without specialisation.

    "translated_abstract": "神经网络运动控制器相对传统控制方法具有各种优点，然而由于其无法产生可靠的精确运动，因此尚未得到广泛采用。本研究探讨了一种双侧神经网络架构作为运动任务的控制系统。我们旨在实现类似于人类在不同任务中观察到的半球专门化：优势系统（通常是右手、左半球）擅长协调和运动效率的任务，而非优势系统在需要位置稳定性的任务上表现更好。通过使用不同的损失函数对半球进行训练，实现了专门化。我们比较了具有专门化半球和无专门化半球、具有半球间连接（代表生物学脑桥）和无半球间连接、具有专门化和无专门化的单侧模型。",
