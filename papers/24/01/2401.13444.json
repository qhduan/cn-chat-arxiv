    "translated_abstract": "在最近的研究中，大型语言模型（LLMs）展示了出色的能力。然而，更新它们的知识面会带来挑战，当面对不熟悉的查询时可能导致不准确性。虽然已经研究了将知识图谱与LLMs集成的方法，但现有方法将LLMs视为主要的决策者，对其能力提出了较高的要求。对于计算成本较低且性能相对较差的LLMs来说，这是不太合适的。本文介绍了一种以线索引导路径探索为核心的知识库问答框架（CGPE），它将知识库与LLMs高效地融合，对模型的能力要求较低。受人类手动检索知识的方法启发，CGPE利用问题中的信息作为线索，系统地探索知识库中所需的知识路径。开源数据集上的实验证明，CGPE优于先前的方法，并且非常适用于计算成本较低且性能较差的LLMs。",
