    "translated_abstract": "地球移动距离（EMD）是计算机视觉和其他应用领域中的两个分布之间的重要相似度度量。然而，其精确计算的计算和内存消耗较大，限制了其在大规模问题上的可扩展性和适用性。为了降低计算成本，提出了各种近似EMD算法，但它们精度较低，可能需要额外的内存使用或手动参数调整。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，称为NNS-EMD，使用最近邻搜索（NNS）来逼近EMD，以实现高精度、低时间复杂度和高内存效率。NNS操作减少了每次NNS迭代中所比较的数据点的数量，并提供了并行处理的机会。我们还通过在GPU上进行向量化来加速NNS-EMD，这对于大型数据集尤为有益。我们将NNS-EMD与精确EMD和最先进的近似EMD算法进行了比较。",
