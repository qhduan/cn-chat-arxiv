    "abstract": "As the number of accepted papers at AI and ML conferences reaches into the thousands, it has become unclear how researchers access and read research publications. In this paper, we investigate the role of social media influencers in enhancing the visibility of machine learning research, particularly the citation counts of papers they share. We have compiled a comprehensive dataset of over 8,000 papers, spanning tweets from December 2018 to October 2023, alongside 1:1 matched controls based on publication year, venue, and abstract topics. Our analysis reveals a significant increase in citations for papers endorsed by these influencers, with median citation counts 2-3 times higher than those of the control group. Additionally, the study delves into the geographic, gender, and institutional diversity of highlighted authors. These findings highlight the expanding influence of social media in scholarly communication and underscore the importance of an evolving ecosystem in today's digital a",

    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能和机器学习会议上被接受的论文数量达到数千篇，研究人员如何获取和阅读研究论文变得不清楚。本文研究了社交媒体影响者在增强机器学习研究可见性中的作用，特别是他们分享的论文引用次数。我们编制了一个包括8000多篇论文的全面数据集，涵盖了2018年12月至2023年10月的推特，以及基于出版年份、会议地点和摘要主题进行1：1匹配的对照组。我们的分析揭示了这些影响者认可的论文引用次数显著增加，中位数引用次数比对照组高2-3倍。此外，该研究还深入研究了被展示作者的地理、性别和机构多样性。这些发现突显了社交媒体在学术交流中的不断扩大的影响力，并强调了当今数字化时代不断发展的生态系统的重要性。",
