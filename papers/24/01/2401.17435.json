    "translated_abstract": "经济选择预测是一项具有挑战性的重要任务，往往受限于获取人类选择数据的困难。实验经济学研究在很大程度上专注于简单的选择环境。最近，人工智能界以两种方式为该努力做出了贡献：考虑大型语言模型是否可以代替人类在上述简单选择预测环境中，以及通过机器学习视角研究更复杂但仍严格的实验经济学环境，包括不完全信息、重复博弈和基于自然语言交流的说服游戏。这引发了一个重要的灵感：大型语言模型是否能够完全模拟经济环境，并生成用于高效人类选择预测的数据，替代复杂的经济实验室研究？我们在这个主题上开创了研究，并展示了其可行性。特别是，我们表明仅在大型语言模型生成的数据上训练的模型可以有效地进行预测。",
