    "translated_abstract": "尽管人工智能取得了显著进展，但当前的物体识别模型在模拟人脑视觉信息处理机制方面仍然落后。最近的研究强调了利用神经数据来模仿大脑处理的潜力；然而，这些研究通常依赖于对非人类实验对象的侵入性神经记录，这在我们对人类视觉感知和开发更类似人类大脑视觉模型的理解上存在着重要的缺口。为了解决这一问题，我们首次提出了“Re(presentational)Al(ignment)net”，这是一个以非侵入性脑电图记录为基础的与人脑活动相对齐的视觉模型，展示了与人脑表示更高的相似性。我们的创新图像到脑多层编码对齐框架不仅优化了模型的多个层次，标志着神经对齐方面的重大突破，而且还使得模型能够高效地学习和模仿人脑的视觉感知能力。",
