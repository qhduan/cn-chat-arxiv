    "translated_abstract": "社交机器人导航在日常生活的各种情景下可以提供帮助，但需要安全的人机交互和高效的轨迹规划。在多Agent交互系统中，建模成对的关系已经被广泛研究，但是捕捉更大规模的群体活动的能力有限。在本文中，我们提出了一种系统的关系推理方法，通过明确推断正在演变的关系结构，展示了其在多Agent轨迹预测和社交机器人导航中的有效性。除了节点对之间的边缘（即Agent），我们还提出了推断超边缘的方法，以自适应地连接多个节点，以便进行群体推理。我们的方法推断动态演化的关系图和超图，以捕捉关系的演化，轨迹预测器利用这些图来生成未来状态。同时，我们提出了对锐度和逻辑稀疏性进行正则化的方法。",
