    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）作为一种保护隐私的分布式学习框架，吸引了广泛的关注。本文关注交叉数据源的FL，其中客户端在训练后成为模型所有者，并且只关心模型在本地数据上的泛化性能。由于数据异质性问题，要求所有客户端参加单一的FL训练过程可能会导致模型性能下降。为了调查合作的有效性，我们首先推导了每个客户端在与其他客户端合作或独立训练时的泛化界限。我们展示了仅通过与具有更多训练数据和相似数据分布的其他客户端合作，可以改善客户端的泛化性能。我们的分析使我们能够通过将客户端分成多个合作组来制定客户端效用最大化问题。然后提出了一种基于层次聚类的合作训练（HCCT）方案。",

By deriving the generalization bound for each client, it is found that improving the generalization performance of a model can only be achieved by collaborating with clients who have more training data and similar data distribution.
