    "translated_abstract": "最近的全球性干扰，如大流行和地缘政治冲突，深刻暴露了传统供应链的脆弱性，需要探索更有弹性的替代方案。自主供应链（ASC）作为潜在解决方案出现，提供了在动荡的贸易环境中增加可见性、灵活性和弹性的优势。尽管工业界和学术界多年来一直在讨论ASC，但缺乏良好建立的理论基础。本文通过提供ASC的正式定义以及其定义特征和辅助概念来填补这一研究空白。我们提出了一个名为MIISI模型的分层概念框架。通过一个重点关注肉类供应链的案例研究，展示了基于这一概念模型的初始ASC实施。此外，我们还引入了一个七级供应链自治参考模型，描绘了实现完全供应链自治的轨迹。",
