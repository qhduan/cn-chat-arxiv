    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在层次化任务网络规划中三个经典问题的可计算边界：提供计划的验证，是否存在可执行计划以及是否可以通过某个计划达到给定状态。我们证明了在常量偏序宽度的原始任务网络（以及其推广形式）上，这三个问题都可以在多项式时间内解决，而对于后两个问题，这种情况仅在对状态空间进行可证明的必要限制下才成立。接下来，我们提供了一个算法元定理及相应的下界，以确定从原始任务网络到一般任务网络的一般多项式时间可解性结果可以被提升的严格条件。最后，我们通过分析这三个问题的参数化复杂度来丰富我们的研究，并且证明了(1)通过将偏序宽度替换为t，可以实现这三个问题的固定参数可计算性。",
