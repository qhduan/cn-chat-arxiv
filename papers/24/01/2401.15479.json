This lack of access to data has been dubbed the Post-API era of Internet research. Fortunately, popular search engines have the means to crawl, capture, and surface social media data on their Search Engine Results Pages (SERP) if provided the proper search query, and may provide a solution to this dilemma. In the present work we ask: does SERP provide a complete and unbiased sample of social media data? Is SERP a viable alternative to direct API-access? To answer these questions, we perform a comparative analysis between (Google) SERP results and nonsampled data from Reddit and Twitter/X. We find that SERP results are highly biased in favor of popular posts; against political, pornographic, and vulgar posts; are more positive in their sentiment; and have large ",

    "translated_abstract": "最近停止访问社交媒体API的决定对互联网研究和整个计算社会科学领域产生了不利影响。这种对数据的访问缺乏已被称为互联网研究的后API时代。幸运的是，流行的搜索引擎有能力爬取、捕获和展示社交媒体数据在其搜索引擎结果页面(SERP)上，如果提供适当的搜索查询，可能会为这一困境提供解决方案。在当前工作中，我们问：SERP是否提供社交媒体数据的完整和无偏见样本？ SERP是否是直接API访问的可行替代方案？为了回答这些问题，我们对（Google）SERP结果和来自Reddit和Twitter/X的非取样数据进行了比较分析。我们发现，SERP结果在支持流行帖子方面存在高度偏见；反对政治、色情和粗俗帖子；在情感上更为积极；并有大",
