    "translated_abstract": "选择理论中一种常见的观点认为，个体在做出选择之前，会先进行两步的过程，首先选择一些备选方案进行考虑，然后从所得的考虑集合中进行选择。然而，在这种“考虑然后选择”的情景下推断未观察到的考虑集合（或者备选方案的考虑概率）面临着重大挑战，因为即使是对于具有强独立性假设的简单考虑模型，在已知备选方案效用的情况下也无法确定身份。我们考虑将考虑-然后-选择模型自然地扩展到top-k排名的情景，假设排名是根据Plackett-Luce模型在采样了考虑集合后构建的。尽管在这种情景下备选方案的考虑概率仍旧不能确定，但我们证明了在获得备选方案效用的知识的情况下，我们可以推断出备选概率相对大小的界限。此外，通过对期望考虑集合大小的条件进行推导，我们得到绝对界限。",
