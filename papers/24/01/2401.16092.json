    "translated_abstract": "最近，文本到图像生成模型在图像质量、灵活性和文本对齐方面取得了令人惊讶的结果，并因此在越来越多的应用中得到应用。通过改善多语言能力，更多的社群现在可以访问这种技术。然而，正如我们将展示的那样，多语言模型与单语模型一样受到(性别)偏见的困扰。此外，人们自然期望这些模型在不同语言之间提供类似的结果，但事实并非如此，不同语言之间存在重要的差异。因此，我们提出了一个旨在促进没有性别偏见的多语言模型研究的新基准MAGBIG。我们研究了多语言T2I模型是否通过MAGBIG放大了性别偏见。为此，我们使用多语言提示请求特定职业或特质的人像图像(使用形容词)。我们的结果不仅表明模型偏离了规范的假设，...",
    "tldr": "多语言文本到图像生成模型存在性别偏见；通过MAGBIG评估模型时，发现模型对不同语言具有重要差异；我们呼吁研究多语言模型领域消除性别偏见。"
