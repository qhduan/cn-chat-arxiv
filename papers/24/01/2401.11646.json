    "translated_abstract": "非参数模型在各个科学和工程领域中备受关注。经典的核方法在低维情况下具有数值稳定性和统计可靠性，但在高维情况下由于维度灾难变得不够适用。在本文中，我们引入了一个名为Variance-Reduced Sketching（VRS）的新框架，专门用于在降低维度灾难的同时在高维度中估计密度函数和非参数回归函数。我们的框架将多变量函数概念化为无限大小的矩阵，并借鉴了数值线性代数文献中的一种新的草图技术来降低估计问题中的方差。我们通过一系列的模拟实验和真实数据应用展示了VRS的鲁棒性能。值得注意的是，在许多密度估计问题中，VRS相较于现有的神经网络估计器和经典的核方法表现出显著的改进。",
