    "translated_abstract": "动机：Mapper算法是拓扑数据分析中探索数据形状的重要工具。使用数据集作为输入，Mapper算法输出代表整个数据集拓扑特征的图形。这个图形通常被认为是数据的一个Reeb图的近似。经典的Mapper算法使用固定的区间长度和重叠比率，这可能无法揭示数据的微妙特征，尤其是当底层结构复杂时。结果：在这项工作中，我们引入了一种名为D-Mapper的分布引导Mapper算法，利用概率模型的属性和数据固有特征生成密度引导的覆盖，并提供增强的拓扑特征。我们提出的算法是一种基于概率模型的方法，可以作为非概率性方法的替代。此外，我们引入了一个度量来考虑重叠聚类的质量和扩展持续同调。",
