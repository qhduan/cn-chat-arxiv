    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)在自然语言处理的一般领域取得了巨大成功。它们的任务概括和自由对话能力可以极大地帮助设计化学智能(CGI)，以协助化学领域的实际研究。然而，在化学领域中存在专业语言和知识，如高度信息化的SMILES符号表示法，阻碍了一般领域LLMs在化学领域的性能。为此，我们开发了ChemDFM，这是首个面向CGI的LLM。ChemDFM-13B是在化学文献、教科书、说明书以及各种一般领域的数据中训练的34B令牌。因此，它可以存储、理解和推理化学知识和语言，同时具有先进的自由形式语言理解能力。广泛的定量评估表明，ChemDFM可以明显优于代表性的开源LLMs。此外，ChemDFM还可以...",
