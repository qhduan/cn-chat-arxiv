    "translated_abstract": "在建模现实世界应用中的3D数据时，发展E(3)群的等变神经网络起着重要作用。实现这种等变性主要涉及到不可约表示（irreps）的张量积。然而，随着使用高阶张量，这些操作的计算复杂性显著增加。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种系统的方法来大大加速不可约表示的张量积的计算。我们将常用的Clebsch-Gordan系数与Gaunt系数进行了数学上的连接，Gaunt系数是三个球形谐波乘积的积分。通过Gaunt系数，不可约表示的张量积等价于由球形谐波表示的球形函数之间的乘法。这种观点进一步使我们能够将等变操作的基础从球形谐波改变为2D傅立叶基础。因此，球形函数之间的乘法可以在傅立叶基础上进行。",
