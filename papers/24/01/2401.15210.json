    "translated_abstract": "关系数据库管理系统(RDBMS)中的查询优化器搜索预期对于给定查询最优的执行计划。它们使用参数估计，通常是不准确的，并且做出的假设在实践中可能不成立。因此，在这些估计和假设无效时，它们可能选择在运行时是次优的执行计划，这可能导致查询性能不佳。因此，查询优化器不足以支持鲁棒的查询优化。近年来，使用机器学习(ML)来提高数据系统的效率并减少其维护开销的兴趣日益高涨，在查询优化领域取得了有希望的结果。在本文中，受到这些进展的启发，并基于IBM Db2多年的经验，我们提出了Roq: 一种基于风险感知学习方法的综合框架，它实现了鲁棒的查询优化。",
