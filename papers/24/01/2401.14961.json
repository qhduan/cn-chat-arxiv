    "translated_abstract": "神经网络容易受到对抗性攻击，即微小的输入扰动可能导致神经网络输出产生重大变化。安全关键环境需要对输入扰动具有鲁棒性的神经网络。然而，训练和形式化验证鲁棒性神经网络是具有挑战性的。我们首次采用端到端基于集合的训练方法来解决这个挑战，该训练方法能够训练出可进行形式化验证的鲁棒性神经网络。我们的训练方法能够大大简化已训练神经网络的后续形式化鲁棒性验证过程。相比于以往的研究主要关注增强神经网络训练的对抗性攻击，我们的方法利用基于集合的计算来训练整个扰动输入集合上的神经网络。此外，我们证明我们的基于集合的训练方法可以有效训练出易于验证的鲁棒性神经网络。",
