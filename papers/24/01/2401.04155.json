    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are a class of artificial intelligence models based on deep learning, which have great performance in various tasks, especially in natural language processing (NLP). Large language models typically consist of artificial neural networks with numerous parameters, trained on large amounts of unlabeled input using self-supervised or semi-supervised learning. However, their potential for solving bioinformatics problems may even exceed their proficiency in modeling human language. In this review, we will present a summary of the prominent large language models used in natural language processing, such as BERT and GPT, and focus on exploring the applications of large language models at different omics levels in bioinformatics, mainly including applications of large language models in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, drug discovery and single cell analysis.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）是一类基于深度学习的人工智能模型，在各种任务中表现出色，尤其在自然语言处理（NLP）中。大型语言模型通常由具有大量参数的人工神经网络组成，通过自监督或半监督学习，在大量无标签输入上进行训练。然而，它们在解决生物信息学问题方面的潜力甚至超过了在模拟人类语言方面的能力。在这篇综述中，我们将介绍在自然语言处理中使用的几个重要的大型语言模型，如BERT和GPT，并重点探讨大型语言模型在生物信息学中不同组学水平的应用，主要包括基因组学、转录组学、蛋白质组学、药物发现和单细胞分析方面的应用。最后，本综述总结了大型语言模型在解决生物信息学问题方面的潜力和前景。",
