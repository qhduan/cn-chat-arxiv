    "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to identify the emotions expressed by individuals through visual, language, and acoustic cues. However, most of the existing research efforts assume that all modalities are available during both training and testing, making their algorithms susceptible to the missing modality scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-transfer network to translate between different modalities to reconstruct the missing audio modalities. Moreover, we develop a cross-modality attention mechanism to retain the maximal information of the reconstructed and observed modalities for sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baselines and achieve comparable results to the previous methods with complete multi-modality supervision.",

    "translated_abstract": "多模态情感分析旨在通过视觉、语言和声音线索来识别个体表达的情绪。然而，现有研究大多假设在训练和测试过程中所有模态都是可用的，这使得它们的算法容易受到缺失模态的影响。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的知识迁移网络，用于在不同模态之间进行翻译，以重构缺失的音频模态。此外，我们还开发了一种跨模态注意机制，以保留重构和观察到的模态的最大信息，用于情感预测。在三个公开数据集上进行的大量实验证明了相对于基线算法的显著改进，并实现了与具有完整多模态监督的先前方法相媲美的结果。",
