    "translated_abstract": "在集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统中，将雷达目标与通信用户设备（UEs）进行匹配对于几种通信任务是有意义的，如主动切换和波束预测。本文考虑了一个雷达辅助通信系统，一个基站（BS）配备有多输入多输出（MIMO）雷达，雷达具有双重目标：（i）将车辆雷达目标与通信波束空间中的车辆设备（VEs）关联起来，（ii）根据雷达数据预测每个VE的波束形成矢量。提出的目标到用户（T2U）关联分为两个阶段。首先，通过距离-角度图像检测车辆雷达目标，并为每个目标估计一个波束形成矢量。然后，将推断得到的每个目标的波束形成矢量与BS用于通信的波束形成矢量进行匹配，以执行目标到用户（T2U）关联。通过修改你只看脸部网络（YOLO）算法实现了联合多目标检测和波束推理。",
