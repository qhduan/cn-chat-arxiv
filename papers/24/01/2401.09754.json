    "translated_abstract": "尽管图神经网络在学习关系数据方面取得了巨大成功，但已经广泛研究发现，图神经网络在同类图上容易受到结构攻击的影响。受此启发，我们提出了一系列鲁棒模型，以增强图神经网络在同类图上的对抗鲁棒性。然而，关于异类图上的脆弱性仍然存在许多未解之谜。为了弥合这一差距，本文开始探索图神经网络在异类图上的脆弱性，并在理论上证明了负分类损失的更新与基于邻居特征的幂和聚合的成对相似性呈负相关。这一理论证明解释了实证观察，即图攻击者倾向于基于邻居特征而不是个体特征连接不相似节点对，无论是在同类图还是异类图上。通过这种方式，我们新颖地引入了一种方法",

Theoretical proof is provided for the negative correlation between the update of the negative classification loss and the pairwise similarities based on the neighbor features. This explains the behavior of the graph attacker connecting dissimilar node pairs. A novel solution is proposed."
