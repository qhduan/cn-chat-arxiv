    "abstract": "We provide a quantitative assessment of welfare in the classical model of risk-sharing and exchange under uncertainty. We prove three kinds of results. First, that in an equilibrium allocation, the scope for improving individual welfare by a given margin (an $\\ve$-improvement) vanishes as the number of states increases. Second, that the scope for a change in aggregate resources that may be distributed to enhance individual welfare by a given margin also vanishes. Equivalently: in an inefficient allocation, for a given level of resource sub-optimality (as measured by the coefficient of resource under-utilization), the possibilities for enhancing welfare by perturbing aggregate resources decrease exponentially to zero with the number of states. Finally, we consider efficient risk-sharing in standard models of uncertainty aversion with multiple priors, and show that, in an inefficient allocation, certain sets of priors shrink with the size of the state space.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们对风险分享和不确定性下的经典模型中的福利进行了定量评估。我们证明了三种结果。首先，在均衡分配中，通过给定的边际提高个体福利（ε-提高）的空间随着状态数的增加而消失。其次，为了提高个体福利，分配给改进聚合资源的范围也消失。等价地说：在低效分配中，对于给定水平的资源次优化（根据资源未充分利用的系数度量），通过扰动聚合资源来增强福利的可能性随状态数的指数增加而变为零。最后，我们考虑了具有多个先验概率的标准不确定性规避中的高效风险分享，并显示在低效分配中，某些先验概率集随着状态空间的大小而缩小。",
