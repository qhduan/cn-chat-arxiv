    "translated_abstract": "背景：深度学习在各个领域取得了显著进展。然而，与传统软件系统一样，深度学习系统也存在Bug，这可能对自动驾驶等领域产生严重影响。尽管深度学习技术取得了重大进展，但很少有研究关注深度学习Bug的可复现性，这阻碍了Bug的解决。现有文献指出，仅有3%的深度学习Bug是可复现的，这凸显了进一步研究的必要性。目标：本文考察深度学习Bug的可复现性，识别可提高深度学习Bug可复现性的编辑动作和有用信息。方法：首先，构建了一个包含来自Stack Overflow和Defects4ML的3个框架和22个架构的668个深度学习Bug的数据集。其次，使用分层抽样选择了102个Bug，并尝试确定它们的可复现性。在复现这些Bug的过程中，我们识别了编辑动作和有用信息。",
