We find that high AI exposure (but not low AI exposure) did not affect the creativity of individual ideas but did increase the average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity.

    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型输出的接触正在迅速增加。观看到AI生成的思想将如何影响人类思想？我们进行了一个实验（800+参与者，40+个国家），参与者观看了来自ChatGPT或之前实验参与者的创意思想，然后进行了自己的创意思考。我们变化了AI生成示例的数量（无、低、高曝光）以及示例是否标记为“AI”（披露）。我们的动态实验设计 - 在同一实验条件下，使用之前参与者的思想作为未来参与者的刺激 - 模拟了文化创造的相互依赖过程：创造性思想建立在之前的思想基础上。因此，我们捕捉到了LLM“在文化循环中”的复合效应。我们发现高AI曝光（但不是低AI曝光）并没有影响个人思想的创造力，但增加了整体思想多样性的平均数量和变化速率。AI使思想多样性的累积效应增强了。",
