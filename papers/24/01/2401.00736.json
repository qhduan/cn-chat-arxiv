    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型（DMs）在图像超分辨率（SR）领域中产生了颠覆性的影响，进一步缩小了图像质量与人类感知偏好之间的差距。它们易于训练，并能生成比以前的生成方法产生的样本更高质量的图像。尽管取得了有希望的结果，但它们也带来了新的挑战，需要进一步的研究：高计算需求、可比性、缺乏可解释性、色彩偏移等。不幸的是，由于大量的出版物，进入这个领域令人难以应对。为了解决这个问题，我们提供了一个统一的叙述，阐明了应用于图像超分辨率的DM的理论基础，并提供了一份详细的分析，突出了该领域内与其他综述文章不同的独特特点和方法。这项调查研究对DM的原则进行了一个连贯的理解，并探索了当前的研究方向，包括替代输入领域等。",
