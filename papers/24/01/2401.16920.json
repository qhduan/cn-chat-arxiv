    "abstract": "This paper uses topological data analysis (TDA) tools and introduces a data-driven clustering-based stock selection strategy tailored for sparse portfolio construction. Our asset selection strategy exploits the topological features of stock price movements to select a subset of topologically similar (different) assets for a sparse index tracking (Markowitz) portfolio. We introduce new distance measures, which serve as an input to the clustering algorithm, on the space of persistence diagrams and landscapes that consider the time component of a time series. We conduct an empirical analysis on the S\\&P index from 2009 to 2020, including a study on the COVID-19 data to validate the robustness of our methodology. Our strategy to integrate TDA with the clustering algorithm significantly enhanced the performance of sparse portfolios across various performance measures in diverse market scenarios.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文使用拓扑数据分析工具，引入了一种针对稀疏投资组合构建的数据驱动聚类型股票选择策略。我们的资产选择策略利用股票价格波动的拓扑特征，选择一组拓扑类似（不同）的资产用于稀疏指数追踪（马科维茨）投资组合。我们引入了在持续图和景观空间上考虑时间成分的新距离度量，作为聚类算法的输入。我们对2009年至2020年的S\\&P指数进行了实证分析，包括对COVID-19数据的研究，以验证我们方法的稳健性。我们将拓扑数据分析与聚类算法相结合的策略显著提升了不同市场情景下稀疏投资组合的综合绩效。",
