    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to transform the practice of law, but this potential is threatened by the presence of legal hallucinations -- responses from these models that are not consistent with legal facts.

Our work makes four key contributions: (1) We develop a typology of legal hallucinations, providing a conceptual framework for future research in this area.
