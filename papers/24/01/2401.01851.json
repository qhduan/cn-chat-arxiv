    "abstract": "This work examines the effects of variations in machine learning training regimes and learning paradigms on the corresponding energy consumption. While increasing data availability and innovation in high-performance hardware fuels the training of sophisticated models, it also supports the fading perception of energy consumption and carbon emission. Therefore, the goal of this work is to create awareness about the energy impact of general training parameters and processes, from learning rate over batch size to knowledge transfer. Multiple setups with different hyperparameter initializations are evaluated on two different hardware configurations to obtain meaningful results. Experiments on pretraining and multitask training are conducted on top of the baseline results to determine their potential towards sustainable machine learning.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨机器学习训练方案和学习范式的变化对相应能源消耗的影响。虽然数据的可用性提高和高性能硬件的创新推动了复杂模型的训练，但也支持了能源消耗和碳排放的消隐。因此，本研究的目标是增加人们对一般训练参数和过程（从学习率到批量大小再到知识传输）的能源影响的认识。使用不同的超参数初始化在两种不同的硬件配置上评估多种设置，以获得有意义的结果。在基准结果上进行了预训练和多任务训练实验，以确定它们对可持续机器学习的潜力。",
