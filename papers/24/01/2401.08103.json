    "abstract": "While the operationalisation of high-level AI ethics principles into practical AI/ML systems has made progress, there is still a theory-practice gap in managing tensions between the underlying AI ethics aspects. We cover five approaches for addressing the tensions via trade-offs, ranging from rudimentary to complex. The approaches differ in the types of considered context, scope, methods for measuring contexts, and degree of justification. None of the approaches is likely to be appropriate for all organisations, systems, or applications. To address this, we propose a framework which consists of: (i) proactive identification of tensions, (ii) prioritisation and weighting of ethics aspects, (iii) justification and documentation of trade-off decisions. The proposed framework aims to facilitate the implementation of well-rounded AI/ML systems that are appropriate for potential regulatory requirements.",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然把高级人工智能伦理原则应用到实际的人工智能/机器学习系统中已经取得了进展，但在处理底层人工智能伦理方面的紧张关系方面仍存在理论与实践之间的差距。我们提出了五种处理这些关系的方法，从简单到复杂不等。这些方法在考虑的上下文类型、范围、衡量上下文的方法和证明程度上有所不同。这些方法中没有一种适用于所有组织、系统或应用。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个框架，包括：（i）积极识别紧张关系，（ii）优先处理和权衡伦理方面，（iii）证明和记录权衡决策。该提议的框架旨在促进实施符合潜在监管要求的全面人工智能/机器学习系统。",
