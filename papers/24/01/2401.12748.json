    "abstract": "We introduce a multivariate version of adapted transport, which we name multicausal transport, involving several filtered processes among which causality constraints are imposed. Subsequently, we consider the barycenter problem for stochastic processes with respect to causal and bicausal optimal transport, and study its connection to specific multicausal transport problems. Attainment and duality of the aforementioned problems are provided. As an application, we study a matching problem in a dynamic setting where agents' types evolve over time. We link this to a causal barycenter problem and thereby show existence of equilibria.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了适应性传输的多元版本，命名为多因果传输，其中涉及多个被施加因果约束的过程。接下来，我们考虑具有因果和双因果最优传输的随机过程的重心问题，并研究其与具体的多因果传输问题的联系。我们提供了前述问题的达到和对偶性。作为一个应用，我们研究了一个动态环境下的匹配问题，其中代理人的类型随时间演变。我们将其与因果重心问题联系起来，并从而展示了均衡的存在性。",
