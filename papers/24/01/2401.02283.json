    "translated_abstract": "航空航天领域的软件开发要求遵循严格、高质量的标准。尽管在这个领域中存在着商用软件的监管指南（例如ARP-4754和DO-178），但这些指南并不适用于具有深度神经网络（DNN）组件的软件。因此，如何使航空航天系统受益于深度学习的革命尚不清楚。我们的研究旨在通过一种新颖的、以输出为中心的方法来解决这个挑战，用于DNN的认证。我们的方法采用统计验证技术，并具有能够标记DNN输出可能不可靠的特定输入的关键优势，以便后续由专家检查。为了实现这一点，我们的方法对DNN对其他附近输入的预测进行统计分析，以检测不一致性。这与现有技术相反，后者通常试图对整个DNN进行认证，而非单个输出。",
