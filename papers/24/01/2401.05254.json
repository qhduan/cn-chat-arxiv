This paper examines the differences between Twitter (X) in the United States and Sina Weibo posts in China on two primary dimensions of affect - valence and arousal. We study the difference in the functional relationship between arousal and valence (so-called V-shaped) among individuals in the US and China and explore the associated content differences. Furthermore, we correlate word usage and topics in both platforms to interpret their differences. We observe that for Twitter users, the variation in emotional intensity is less distinct between negative and positive emotions compared to Weibo users, and there is a sharper escalation in arousal corresponding with heightened emotions.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管社交媒体上个体的情感表达已经得到了广泛研究，但研究主要集中在西方环境中。不同文化之间存在着引发情感表达的重要差异。本文研究了美国Twitter和中国新浪微博上的两个主要情感维度（价值和激动）之间的差异。我们研究了美国和中国个体之间的激动和价值之间的功能关系差异，并探讨了相关内容上的差异。此外，我们还对两个平台上的词语使用和话题进行了相关性分析，以解读它们之间的差异。我们观察到，对于Twitter用户来说，负面情绪和正面情绪之间的情感强度变化不太明显，而对于新浪微博用户来说，伴随着情感的上升，激动程度有更明显的升级。从语言特征中，我们发现情感表达方面的差异。",
