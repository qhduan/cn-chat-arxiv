    "translated_abstract": "水体中的入侵物种对全球环境和生物多样性构成了重大威胁。由于交通和贸易增加，非本土物种已经引入了新的环境，导致生态系统破坏，并导致农业、林业和渔业方面的经济损失。因此，迫切需要风险评估和管理技术以减轻这些入侵的影响。本研究旨在开发一种新的受物理启发的模型，用于预测海事航运交通流量，并以此指导通过全球交通网络传播的入侵物种风险评估。受国际贸易重力模型的启发，我们的模型考虑了影响船舶活动可能性和影响的各种因素，如航运通量密度、港口之间的距离、贸易流量和交通枢纽的中心性指标。此外，通过分析入侵物种的风险网络，我们为评估和管理入侵提供了全面的框架。",
