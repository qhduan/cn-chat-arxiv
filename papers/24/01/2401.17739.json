    "abstract": "There is a mystery at the heart of operator learning: how can one recover a non-self-adjoint operator from data without probing the adjoint? Current practical approaches suggest that one can accurately recover an operator while only using data generated by the forward action of the operator without access to the adjoint. However, naively, it seems essential to sample the action of the adjoint. In this paper, we partially explain this mystery by proving that without querying the adjoint, one can approximate a family of non-self-adjoint infinite-dimensional compact operators via projection onto a Fourier basis. We then apply the result to recovering Green's functions of elliptic partial differential operators and derive an adjoint-free sample complexity bound. While existing theory justifies low sample complexity in operator learning, ours is the first adjoint-free analysis that attempts to close the gap between theory and practice.",

    "translated_abstract": "算子学习中存在一个谜团：如何在没有探测伴随算子的情况下从数据中恢复非自伴随算子？目前的实际方法表明，在仅使用由算子的正向作用生成的数据的情况下，可以准确地恢复算子，而不需要访问伴随算子。然而，以直观的方式看，似乎有必要采样伴随算子的作用。在本文中，我们部分解释了这个谜团，通过证明在不查询伴随算子的情况下，可以通过在Fourier基上进行投影来逼近一类非自伴随的无限维紧算子。然后，我们将该结果应用于恢复椭圆型偏微分算子的格林函数，并导出一个无需伴随算子的样本复杂度界限。虽然现有的理论证明了算子学习的低样本复杂度，但我们的是第一个试图填补理论与实践差距的无需伴随算子的分析。",
