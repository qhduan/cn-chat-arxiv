    "translated_abstract": "开放式无线接入网络（O-RAN）技术作为一种有前景的解决方案，为网络运营商提供了一个开放和有利的环境。在O-RAN内确保有效地协调x应用程序（xAPPs）对于网络切片和资源分配至关重要。本文介绍了一种创新的资源分配方法，旨在协调O-RAN中多个独立xAPPs的协调。我们的方法侧重于在用户设备（UE）之间最大化加权吞吐量，并分配物理资源块（PRBs）。我们优先考虑增强型移动宽带和超可靠低延迟通信这两种服务类型。为此，我们设计了两个xAPPs：每个UE的功率控制xAPP和PRB分配xAPP。所提出的方法包括两个部分的训练阶段，其中第一部分使用带有变分自动编码器的监督学习进行训练。",
