Standard RC has been shown to be equivalent in the asymptotic limit to Recurrent Kernels, which helps in analyzing its expressive power. However, many well-established RC paradigms, such as Leaky RC, Sparse RC, and Deep RC, are yet to be analyzed in such a way. This study aims to fill this gap by providing an empirical analysis of the equivalence of specific RC architectures with their corresponding Recurrent Kernel formulation. We conduct a convergence study by varying the activation function implemented in each architecture. Our study also sheds light on the role of sparse connections in RC architectures and propose an optimal sparsity level that depends on the reservoir size.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，由于其快速高效的计算能力，储备计算（RC）变得越来越受欢迎。标准的RC在渐近极限下已被证明与循环内核等效，这有助于分析其表达能力。然而，许多已建立的RC范例，如Leaky RC、Sparse RC和Deep RC，尚未以这种方式进行分析。本研究旨在通过提供特定RC体系结构与相应循环内核形式等价性的经验分析来填补这一空白。我们通过改变每个体系结构中实施的激活函数进行收敛研究。我们的研究还揭示了稀疏连接在RC体系结构中的作用，并提出了一种依赖储备大小的最佳稀疏性水平。此外，我们的系统分析表明，在Deep RC模型中，通过减小尺寸的连续储备可以更好地实现收敛。",
