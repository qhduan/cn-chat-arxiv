    "translated_abstract": "结构化矩阵估计问题通常在强噪声依赖假设下进行研究。本文考虑噪声低秩加稀疏矩阵恢复的一般框架，其中噪声矩阵可以来自任意具有元素间任意依赖的联合分布。我们提出了一个无关相位约束的最小二乘估计器，并且证明了它在各种噪声分布下都是紧致的，既满足确定性下界又匹配最小化风险。为了实现这一点，我们建立了一个新颖的结果，断言两个任意的低秩无关矩阵之间的差异必须在其元素上扩散能量，换句话说不能太稀疏，这揭示了无关低秩矩阵的结构，可能引起独立兴趣。然后，我们展示了我们框架在几个重要的统计机器学习问题中的应用。在估计结构化马尔可夫转移核的问题中，采用了这种方法。",
