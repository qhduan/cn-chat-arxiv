The focus of these disciplines is strictly on human values which limits the depth and breadth of their insights. Recently, attempts to expand to a sentientist perspective have been initiated. We argue that neither of these outlooks is sufficient to capture the actual complexity of the biosphere and ensure that AI does not damage it. Thus, we propose a new paradigm -- Biospheric AI that assumes an ecocentric perspective. We discuss hypothetical ways in which such an AI might be designed. Moreover, we give directions for research and application of the modern AI models that would be consistent with the biospheric interests. All in all, this work attempts to take first steps towards a comprehensive program of research that focuses on the interactions between AI and the biosphere.",

    "translated_abstract": "在人工智能伦理和价值调整领域中，人类中心主义占据主导地位。这些学科的关注重点仅限于人类价值观，导致其洞察力的深度和广度受限。最近，一些学者已开始尝试扩大到以感知者为中心的视角。我们认为，这两种观点都不足以捕捉生物圈的实际复杂性，并确保人工智能不会对其造成损害。因此，我们提出了一种新的范式——生物圈人工智能，它采用了一个生态中心主义的视角。我们讨论了这种人工智能可能被设计的假设性方式。此外，我们还提出了与生物圈利益一致的现代人工智能模型研究和应用的方向。总的来说，这项工作试图迈出首要步骤，研究人工智能与生物圈之间的相互作用。",
