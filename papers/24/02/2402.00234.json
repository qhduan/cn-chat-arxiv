    "translated_abstract": "患有复杂疾病如癌症的患者面临复杂的信息挑战，他们不仅需要了解他们的疾病，还需要学会如何管理它。与医疗专家（放射科医师、肿瘤科医师）密切互动可以提高患者的学习能力，从而改善疾病预后。然而，这种方法资源密集且占用了专家的时间，使他们无法完成其他关键任务。鉴于生成式AI模型在改进医疗系统方面的最新进展，我们的工作研究了生成式视觉问答系统在放射学成像数据背景下如何负责任地支持患者的信息需求。我们进行了一项形成性需求发现研究，参与者讨论了一个虚构近亲的胸部计算机断层扫描（CT）图像和相关的放射学报告。通过对参与者和医疗专家之间的对话的主题分析，我们确定常见的医学信息需求和问题。",
