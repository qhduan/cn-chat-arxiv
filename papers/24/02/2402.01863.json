    "translated_abstract": "在现实设备领域中，联邦学习（FL）中的集中式服务器存在通信瓶颈和容易受到单点故障的挑战。此外，现有设备固有地表现出模型和数据的异质性。现有工作缺乏一个能够适应此异质性且不施加架构限制或假定公共数据可用的分散式FL（DFL）框架。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个分散式联邦互联学习（DFML）框架，该框架是无服务器的，支持非限制性的异构模型，并避免依赖公共数据。DFML通过相互学习在客户端之间传授知识，并循环改变监督和提取信号的数量来有效处理模型和数据的异质性。广泛的实验结果表明，DFML在收敛速度和全局准确性方面具有一致的有效性，优于普遍存在的方法。",
