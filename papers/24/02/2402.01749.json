    "translated_abstract": "机器学习技术现已成为智能城市服务进步的核心，对提高城市环境的效率、可持续性和宜居性起到至关重要的作用。最近出现的ChatGPT等基础模型在机器学习和人工智能领域标志着一个革命性的转变。它们在上下文理解、问题解决和适应各种任务方面的无与伦比的能力表明，将这些模型整合到城市领域中可能对智能城市的发展产生变革性影响。尽管对城市基础模型（UFMs）的兴趣日益增长，但这个新兴领域面临着一些挑战，如缺乏清晰的定义、系统性的综述和可普遍化的解决方案。为此，本文首先介绍了UFM的概念，并讨论了构建它们所面临的独特挑战。然后，我们提出了一个以数据为中心的分类方法，对当前与UFM相关的工作进行了分类。",
