    "translated_abstract": "在大规模基因组学或转录组数据上进行机器学习对许多新颖的健康应用至关重要。例如，精准医学可以根据个体生物标志物、细胞和分子状态等个体信息来量身定制医学治疗。然而，所需数据敏感、庞大、异质，并且通常分布在无法使用专门的机器学习硬件的地点。由于隐私和监管原因，在可信任的第三方处聚合所有数据也存在问题。联邦学习是这一困境的一个有前途的解决方案，因为它实现了在不交换原始数据的情况下进行分散、协作的机器学习。在本文中，我们使用联邦学习框架 TensorFlow Federated 和 Flower 进行比较实验。我们的测试案例是培训疾病预后和细胞类型分类模型。我们使用分布式转录组对模型进行训练",
