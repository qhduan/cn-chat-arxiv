    "translated_abstract": "仅靠测试通过来评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的代码合成能力可能会导致不公正的评估或促进具有数据泄漏的模型，作为一种替代方案，我们介绍了CodeMind，这是一个旨在评估LLMs的代码推理能力的框架。CodeMind目前支持三种代码推理任务：独立执行推理（IER）、依赖执行推理（DER）和规范推理（SR）。前两者评估模型以预测任意代码的执行输出，或者模型能够正确合成的代码。第三个任务评估LLMs实现指定预期行为的程度。我们使用CodeMind对两种不同编程语言中的五个基准下的九个LLMs进行了广泛的评估，结果表明LLMs能够公正地理解控制流结构，并且对于简单程序和复杂程序，它们通常能够推理出输入如何演变为输出。",

    "en_tdlr": "CodeMind is a framework designed to challenge large language models for code reasoning. It introduces an alternative evaluation method to solely relying on test passing, and evaluates the code reasoning abilities of these models through three tasks. The evaluation results show that the models are capable of understanding control flow structures and reasoning input-output relationships for both simple and complex programs."
