    "translated_abstract": "在区块链协议中，用户通过交易手续费机制（TFM）进行竞标，以便将其交易包含并获得确认。Roughgarden（EC'21）对TFM进行了正式的处理，并提出了三个要求：用户激励兼容性（UIC），矿工激励兼容性（MIC）以及一种称为OCA-proofness的防勾结性形式。当没有交易之间的竞争时，Ethereum的EIP-1559机制同时满足这三个属性，但当有过多的符合条件的交易无法放入单个区块时，失去了UIC属性。Chung和Shi（SODA'23）考虑了一种替代的防勾结性概念，称为c-side-construct-proofness(c-SCP)，并证明了当交易之间存在竞争时，任何TFM都不能满足UIC、MIC和至少为1的任何c的c-SCP。OCA-proofness断言用户和矿工不应该能够从协议中“偷取”，并且在直觉上比UIC、MIC更弱。",
    "tldr": "本论文研究了交易手续费机制设计中的防勾结性问题，讨论了多个要求和属性，并指出在存在交易竞争时，任何TFM都无法同时满足所有要求和属性。",
