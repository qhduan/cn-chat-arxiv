To mitigate the potential harms of user fraud, we study the problem of policing such fraud as a security game between an administrator and users.

    "translated_abstract": "跨应用程序中普遍存在欺诈或非法活动，并涉及用户绕过法律，通常以获取一些在合法行为范围内无法获得的利益为战略目的。然而，用户欺诈具有负面影响，可能危害安全或对特定人群施加不成比例的负面外部性。为减轻用户欺诈的潜在危害，我们将欺诈行为监管问题视为管理员和用户之间的安全游戏。在这个游戏中，管理员通过$R$个安全资源（例如警察）在$L$个位置部署，并对在这些位置进行欺诈的用户征收罚款。对于这个安全游戏，我们研究了管理员的福利和收入最大化目标。在两种设置中，我们展示了计算最优管理员策略是NP难题，并为此开发了自然的贪婪算法变体。",
