    "translated_abstract": "传输熵（TE）是信息论中揭示过程之间信息流动方向的度量，对各种实际应用提供了宝贵的见解。本研究提出了一种名为TREET的基于Transformer的传输熵估计方法，用于估计稳定过程的TE。所提出的方法利用Donsker-Vardhan（DV）表示法对TE进行估计，并利用注意力机制进行神经估计任务。我们对TREET进行了详细的理论和实证研究，并将其与现有方法进行了比较。为了增加其适用性，我们设计了一种基于功能表示引理的估计TE优化方案。之后，我们利用联合优化方案来优化具有记忆性的通信通道容量，这是信息论中的一个典型优化问题，并展示了我们估计器的记忆能力。",
