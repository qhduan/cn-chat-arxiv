    "translated_abstract": "大语言模型（LLM）代理已经越来越多地被采用作为模拟工具，用于模拟人类在社会科学等领域中的行为。然而，一个基本的问题仍然存在：LLM代理是否真的能够模拟人类行为？在本文中，我们专注于人类互动中最关键的行为之一，信任，旨在调查LLM代理是否能够模拟人类的信任行为。我们首先发现，在被行为经济学广泛接受的信任游戏框架下，LLM代理通常表现出信任行为，称为代理信任。然后，我们发现LLM代理在信任行为方面与人类具有较高的行为一致性，表明使用LLM代理模拟人类的信任行为是可行的。此外，我们还探索了代理信任中的偏见以及代理信任在对代理和人类之间的差异方面的内在特性。我们还探讨了包括高级推理策略在内的条件下代理信任的内在特性。",
