    "translated_abstract": "在自然语言处理领域，大型语言模型（LLMs）引发了一场范式转变，显著提升了自然语言生成任务的性能。尽管取得了这些进展，对LLMs的全面评估仍然是社区面临的必然挑战。最近，将多选题回答（MCQA）作为LLMs的基准已经引起了广泛关注。本研究调查了MCQA作为LLMs评估方法的合理性。如果LLMs真正理解问题的语义，它们的性能应该在从相同问题派生的各种配置上表现一致。然而，我们的实证结果表明LLMs的响应一致性存在显著差异，我们将之定义为LLMs的响应可变性综合征（REVAS），这表明目前基于MCQA的基准可能无法充分捕捉LLMs的真实能力，强调了对更合适的评估方法的需要。",
