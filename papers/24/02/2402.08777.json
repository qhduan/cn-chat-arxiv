    "translated_abstract": "有效的DNA嵌入在基因组分析中仍然至关重要，特别是在缺乏用于模型微调的标记数据的情况下，尽管基因组基础模型已经取得了显著进展。一个典型的例子是宏基因组分箱，这是微生物组研究中的一个关键过程，旨在通过来自可能包含成千上万个不同的、通常没有经过表征的物种的复杂混合DNA序列的物种来对DNA序列进行分组。为了填补有效的DNA嵌入模型的缺陷，我们引入了DNABERT-S，这是一个专门用于创建物种感知的DNA嵌入的基因组基础模型。为了鼓励对易出错的长读DNA序列进行有效嵌入，我们引入了Manifold Instance Mixup(MI-Mix)，一种对比目标，它在随机选择的层次中混合DNA序列的隐藏表示，并训练模型以在输出层识别和区分这些混合比例。",
