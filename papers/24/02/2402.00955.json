    "translated_abstract": "在医疗保健领域中，确保预测模型的公平性至关重要。电子健康记录（EHR）已成为医疗决策的重要组成部分，然而现有的增强模型公平性的方法仅限于单模态数据，并未解决EHR中与人口统计因素交织在一起的多方面社会偏见。为了减轻这些偏见，我们提出了FairEHR-CLP：一种公平感知临床预测的通用框架，通过对比学习在EHR中进行操作。FairEHR-CLP通过两个阶段的过程操作，利用患者人口统计数据、纵向数据和临床记录。首先，为每个患者生成合成对应来实现多样化的人口统计身份，同时保留必要的健康信息。其次，公平感知预测利用对比学习将患者的表示在敏感属性上进行对齐，与具有softmax层的MLP分类器共同优化用于临床分类任务。",
