This paper shows how algorithm aversion arises when the choice to follow an algorithm conveys information about a human's ability. I develop a model in which workers make forecasts of a random outcome based on their own private information and an algorithm's signal. Low-skill workers receive worse information than the algorithm and hence should always follow the algorithm's signal, while high-skill workers receive better information than the algorithm and should sometimes override it. However, due to reputational concerns, low-skill workers inefficiently override the algorithm to increase the likelihood they are perceived as high-skill. The model provides a fully rational microfoundation for algorithm aversion that aligns with the broad concern that AI systems will displace many types of workers.",

    "translated_abstract": "人们常常不愿将算法产生的信息纳入自己的决策中，这种现象被称为“算法厌恶”。本文展示了算法厌恶是如何产生的，当选择跟随算法传达有关人类能力的信息时。我建立了一个模型，其中工作者根据自己的私人信息和算法的信号对随机结果进行预测。低技能工作者接收到比算法更差的信息，因此应始终遵循算法的信号，而高技能工作者接收到比算法更好的信息，因此有时应该覆盖算法的决策。然而，由于声誉上的考虑，低技能工作者会不合理地覆盖算法，以增加被视为高技能的可能性。该模型为与AI系统可能会取代许多类型的工作者的广泛关注提供了完全理性的微观基础。",
