    "translated_abstract": "深度操作网络（DeepONets）是一类学习函数空间之间映射的神经算子，最近被开发为参数化偏微分方程（PDEs）的代理模型。本文提出了一种导数增强的深度操作网络（DE-DeepONet），它利用导数信息增强预测准确性，提供更准确的导数近似，特别是在训练数据有限的情况下。DE-DeepONet将输入的维度缩减到DeepONet中，并在训练的损失函数中包含两种类型的导数标签，即关于输入函数的输出函数的方向导数和关于物理域变量的输出函数的梯度。我们通过在三个不断增加复杂度的方程上测试DE-DeepONet，以展示其相对于普通DeepONet的有效性。",
