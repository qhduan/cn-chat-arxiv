    "translated_abstract": "共享研究数据是复杂、劳动密集、昂贵的，需要多个利益相关者的基础设施投资。开放科学政策侧重于数据发布而不是数据重用，然而重用也是困难、昂贵的，可能永远不会发生。通过考虑谁可能重用数据，如何重用数据，为何重用数据，以及何时重用数据等因素，可以更明智地进行数据管理投资。数据创造者无法预见所有可能的重用或重用者；我们的目标是确定可能有助于利益相关者决定如何投资研究数据，如何确定潜在的重用和重用者，以及如何改进数据交换过程的因素。基于数据共享和重用的实证研究，我们开发了数据创建者和数据重用者之间距离的理论构建，并确定了影响有效传递知识能力的六个距离维度：领域、方法、合作、策划、目的和时间性。这些维度主要是",
