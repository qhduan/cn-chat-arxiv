This comparison can be conducted by dividing the space into non-overlapping regions and comparing the number of data samples in each region. The method only requires samples from the generative model and the test data. It is capable of functioning directly on high-dimensional data, obviating the need for dimensionality reduction. Significantly, the proposed method does not depend on assumptions regarding the density of the true distribution, and it does not rely on training or fitting any auxiliary models.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种全面的基于样本的方法来评估生成模型的质量。所提出的方法能够估计两个样本集合来自同一分布的概率，为评估单个生成模型的性能或比较在同一数据集上训练的多个竞争模型提供了一个统计上严格的方法。该比较可以通过将空间划分为非重叠的区域并比较每个区域中的数据样本数量来进行。该方法仅需要生成模型和测试数据的样本。它能够直接处理高维数据，无需降维。显著的是，该方法不依赖于关于真实分布密度的假设，并且不依赖于训练或拟合任何辅助模型。相反，它着重于近似计算密度的积分（概率质量）。",
