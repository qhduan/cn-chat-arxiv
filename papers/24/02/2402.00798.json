    "translated_abstract": "最近，对于大型语言模型（LLMs）的进展使得人工智能智能体能够自动生成和执行解决复杂任务的多步计划。然而，由于LLM的内容生成过程几乎无法控制，当前的LLM智能体经常生成无效或不可执行的计划，这损害了生成计划的性能并破坏了用户对LLM智能体的信任。为应对这个问题，本文提出了一种新颖的“正式-LLM”框架，用于LLM智能体，通过将自然语言的表达力和形式语言的精确性进行整合。具体而言，该框架允许人类用户将他们对计划过程的要求或约束表达为自动机。然后，在自动机的监督下，使用基于堆栈的LLM计划生成过程来确保生成的计划满足约束条件，从而使计划过程可控。我们在基准任务和实际的真实任务上进行了实验，并且obtained significant improvements over existing LLM-based agents, demonstrating the effectiveness and controllability of the proposed Formal-LLM framework.",
