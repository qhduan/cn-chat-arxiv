    "abstract": "The healthcare landscape is evolving, with patients seeking more reliable information about their health conditions, treatment options, and potential risks. Despite the abundance of information sources, the digital age overwhelms individuals with excess, often inaccurate information. Patients primarily trust doctors and hospital staff, highlighting the need for expert-endorsed health information. However, the pressure on experts has led to reduced communication time, impacting information sharing. To address this gap, we propose CataractBot, an experts-in-the-loop chatbot powered by large language models (LLMs). Developed in collaboration with a tertiary eye hospital in India, CataractBot answers cataract surgery related questions instantly by querying a curated knowledge base, and provides expert-verified responses asynchronously. CataractBot features multimodal support and multilingual capabilities. In an in-the-wild deployment study with 49 participants, CataractBot proved valuable,",

    "translated_abstract": "随着医疗行业的发展，患者越来越追求更可靠的健康信息，包括他们的健康状况、治疗选择和潜在风险。虽然有很多信息来源，但数字时代却给人们带来了过多且错误的信息。患者主要信任医生和医院工作人员，突显了专家认可的健康信息的必要性。但是，专家面临的压力导致了沟通时间的减少，影响了信息的共享。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了CataractBot，一种由大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动的专家辅助聊天机器人。与印度一家三级眼科医院合作开发的CataractBot通过查询策划的知识库，即时回答白内障手术相关的问题，并异步提供专家验证的答复。CataractBot具备多模式支持和多语言能力。在与49名参与者的实地部署研究中，CataractBot证明了其价值所在。",
