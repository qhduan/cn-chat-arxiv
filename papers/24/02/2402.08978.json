    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.08978v1 公告类型:跨领域 摘要:金融集群分析使投资者能够发现投资替代品，并避免承担过高的风险。然而，这种分析任务面临许多挑战，如大量的两两比较、时间跨度的动态相关性以及从业务关系知识中得出推论的模糊性。我们提出了Prismatic，一种可视化分析系统，它整合了历史性能的定量分析和业务关系知识的定性分析，以交互方式对相关业务进行集群分析。Prismatic具有三个集群生成过程：动态集群生成、基于知识的集群探索和基于相关性的集群验证。利用多视角集群分析方法，它通过知识驱动的相似性丰富了数据驱动的集群，提供了对业务相关性的细致理解。通过良好协调的可视化视图，Prismatic便于了解企业的关联性。",
