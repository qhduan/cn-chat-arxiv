Our goal is to evaluate the consistency between LLMs' professed personality inclinations and their actual \"behavior\", examining the extent to which these models can emulate human-like personality patterns. Through a comprehensive analysis of LLM outputs against established human benchmarks, we seek to understand the cognition-action divergence in LLMs and propose hypotheses for the observed results based on psychological theories and metrics.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项研究中，我们通过回答人格问卷调查来探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在表达类人个性特征方面的可靠性。我们的目标是评估LLMs所表达的个性倾向与它们实际“行为”之间的一致性，检验这些模型能够模拟类人个性模式的程度。通过全面分析LLM输出与已建立的人类基准之间的对比，我们试图了解LLMs中认知与行为之间的差异，并根据心理理论和指标对观察结果提出假设。",
