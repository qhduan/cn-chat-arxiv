    "translated_abstract": "对于缺乏研究培训的初学者研究者来说，研究调查一直是一个挑战。这些研究者在短时间内很难理解他们研究主题内的方向，以及发现新的研究发现。为初学者研究者提供直观的帮助的一种方式是提供相关的知识图谱(KG)并推荐相关的学术论文。然而，现有的导航知识图谱主要依赖于研究领域的关键字，常常无法清楚地呈现多个相关论文之间的逻辑层次关系。此外，大多数学术论文推荐系统仅仅依赖于高文本相似性，这可能会让研究人员困惑为什么推荐了特定的文章。他们可能缺乏了解关于他们希望获得的\"问题解决\"和\"问题发现\"之间的见解连接的重要信息。为解决这些问题，本研究旨在支持初学者研究者进行研究调研。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种分层树状知识图谱和推荐系统，帮助初学者研究者进行研究调研，填补了现有导航知识图谱的不足，并解决了学术论文推荐系统中高文本相似性带来的困惑。"
