    "translated_abstract": "虽然神经网络（NN）作为面向目标的控制器在网络物理系统中具有巨大潜力，但验证基于神经网络的控制系统（NNCS）的安全性对于实际应用NN来说面临着重大挑战，特别是当需要对无界时间范围进行安全性验证时。我们引入了VerSAILLE（通过逻辑链接包验证的可验证安全人工智能）：这是差分动态逻辑（dL）和NN验证组合的第一种方法。通过合作，我们可以利用NN验证工具的效率，同时保留dL的严谨性。我们提出了一个控制器信封的安全性证明，以证明无限时间范围上具体NNCS的安全性。VerSAILLE导致的NN验证属性通常需要非线性算术，而高效的NN验证工具仅支持线性算术。",
