    "translated_abstract": "最近深度学习研究取得了在计算机视觉（CV）和自然语言处理（NLP）等许多任务上显著的成就。CV和NLP交叉点上的图像字幕问题中，相关模型对抗攻击的稳健性尚未得到充分研究。本文提出了一种新颖的对抗攻击策略，称为AICAttack（基于注意力的图像字幕攻击），旨在通过对图像进行微小扰动来攻击图像字幕模型。在黑盒攻击环境中运行，我们的算法不需要访问目标模型的架构、参数或梯度信息。我们引入了基于注意力的候选选择机制，可识别最佳像素进行攻击，然后采用差分进化（DE）来扰乱像素的RGB值。通过对基准上的广泛实验，我们证明了AICAttack的有效性。",
