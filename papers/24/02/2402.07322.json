    "translated_title": "第一价拍卖均衡中的干扰：偏差和方差分析",
    "translated_abstract": "在互联网行业中，在线A/B测试被广泛用于决策新功能的推出。然而对于在线市场（如广告市场），标准的A/B测试方法可能导致结果出现偏差，因为买家在预算约束下运作，试验组的预算消耗会影响对照组的表现。为了解决这种干扰，可以采用“预算分割设计”，即每个实验组都有一个独立的预算约束，并且每个实验组接收相等的预算份额，从而实现“预算控制的A/B测试”。尽管预算控制的A/B测试有明显的优势，但当预算分割得太小时，性能会下降，限制了这种系统的总吞吐量。本文提出了一种并行的预算控制的A/B测试设计，通过市场细分的方式在更大的市场中识别子市场，并在每个子市场上进行并行实验。我们的贡献如下：首先，引入了一种新的方法来分析第一价拍卖的均衡状况，揭示了其中的偏差和方差。",
