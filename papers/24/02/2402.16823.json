    "translated_abstract": "多种人类设计的提升技术被提出，用于改进基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的问题求解器，产生了许多不同的代码库。我们通过将LLM代理描述为计算图来统一这些方法。节点实现处理多模态数据或查询LLMs的功能，并且边描述操作之间的信息流动。图形可以递归地组合成代表不同代理之间协作层次的更大组合图（其中边连接不同代理的操作）。我们的新颖自动图优化器（1）优化节点级LLM提示（节点优化）并（2）通过改变图连接性来改善代理协调（边缘优化）。实验证明我们的框架可用于高效开发、集成和自动改进各种LLM代理。代码可在https://github.com/metauto-ai/gptswarm找到。",
