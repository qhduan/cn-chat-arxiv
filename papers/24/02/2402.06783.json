    "translated_abstract": "模拟到现实（sim-to-real）的迁移是机器人学习中的一个基本问题。域随机化是一种在训练过程中添加随机性的强大技术，可以有效解决模拟与现实之间的差距。然而，观测中的噪声使得学习变得更加困难。最近的研究表明，采用教师-学生学习范式可以加速随机化环境中的训练。通过使用特权信息进行学习，教师智能体可以指导学生智能体在噪声环境中操作。然而，这种方法通常不是样本效率的，因为在训练学生智能体时完全舍弃了教师智能体收集的经验，浪费了环境所透露的信息。在这项工作中，我们通过提出一个名为学习教学（L2T）的样本效率学习框架来扩展教师-学生学习范式，该框架可以回收教师智能体收集的经验。我们观察到，对于一对教师-学生智能体，环境的动态特性对两者都有重要影响。",
