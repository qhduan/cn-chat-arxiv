The OEs are imposed exogenously by a regulated distribution system operator (DSO) on the energy community's revenue meter that is subject to a generalized net energy metering (NEM) tariff design. By formulating the interaction of the community manager and its members as a Stackelberg game, we show that the proposed two-part pricing achieves a Nash equilibrium and maximizes the community's social welfare in a decentralized fashion while ensuring that the community's operation abides by the OEs. The market mechanism conforms with the cost-causation principle and guarantees community members a surplus level no less than their maximum surplus when they autonomously face the DSO. The dynamic and uniform community price is a monotonically decreasing function of the community's aggregate renew",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于运营包络（OEs）的能源社区市场机制，根据双部定价动态收费/奖励其成员。OE由监管的配电系统运营商（DSO）外部强加在能源社区的收入表上，该表受到广义净能量计量（NEM）电价设计的约束。通过将社区管理者与其成员的互动建模为Stackelberg博弈，我们表明所提出的双部定价实现了纳什均衡，并通过分散式方式最大化了社区的社会福利，同时确保社区的运营遵守OE。市场机制符合成本因果关系原则，保证社区成员的剩余水平至少不低于他们自主面对DSO时的最大剩余。动态且统一的社区价格是社区总体可再生能源的单减函数。",
