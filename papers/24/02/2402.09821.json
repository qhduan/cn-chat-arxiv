    "translated_title": "音频恢复的扩散模型",
    "translated_abstract": "随着音频播放设备和快速数据传输的发展，对高音质的需求在娱乐和通信领域不断增长。然而，由于录制过程中的失真和干扰，或者由于不完善的传输管道，音频质量面临许多挑战。为了解决这个问题，音频恢复方法旨在从损坏的输入数据中恢复出清晰的音频信号。本文介绍了基于扩散模型的音频恢复算法，重点关注语音增强和音乐恢复任务。传统方法通常基于手工规则和统计启发法，从而建立了我们对音频信号的认识。近几十年来，越来越多的人转向利用深度神经网络（DNNs）的建模能力的数据驱动方法。深度生成模型中的扩散模型成为一种新兴方法。",
