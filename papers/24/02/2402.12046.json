We put NLP's propensity to cite older work in the context of these 20 other fields to analyze whether NLP shows similar temporal citation patterns to these other fields over time or whether differences can be observed. Our analysis, based on a dataset of approximately 240 million papers, reveals a broader scientific trend: many fields have markedly declined in citing older works (e.g., psychology, computer science). We term this decline a 'citation age recession', analogous to how economists define periods of reduced economic activity. The trend is strongest in NLP and ML research (-12.8% and -5.5% in citation age from previous peaks).

    "translated_abstract": "这项研究考察了在43年的时间跨度（1980-2023年）内，在20个研究领域中倾向于引用较旧作品的趋势。我们将自然语言处理(NLP)倾向于引用较旧作品的特性放在其他20个领域的背景下进行分析，以探讨NLP是否展现出与其他领域随时间出现类似的引文模式，或者是否可以观察到差异。我们的分析基于约2.4亿篇论文的数据集，揭示了一个更广泛的科学趋势：许多领域在引用较旧作品方面明显下降（例如心理学、计算机科学）。我们将这种下降称为“引文年龄衰退”，类似于经济学家如何定义减少经济活动的时期。这一趋势在NLP和机器学习研究中最为显著（引文年龄从先前高峰下降了12.8%和5.5%）。我们的结果表明，对更近期作品的引用并非直接受到出版速率增长的推动（跨领域下降了3.4%，人文学科下降了5.2%，形式科学下降了5.5%）--即使在控制了发表数量时。",
