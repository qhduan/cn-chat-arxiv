    "translated_abstract": "在学校中，大规模的课堂规模给个性化学习带来了挑战，教育技术，尤其是智能辅导系统（ITS）试图解决这个问题。在这个背景下，基于学习进展假设（LPH）和多臂赌博机器学习技术的ZPDES算法对最大化学习进展（LP）的练习进行排序。该算法在之前的实地研究中已经显示出将学习表现提升到更广泛的学生群体中，与手工设计的课程相比。然而，其动机影响尚未评估。此外，ZPDES不允许学生发表选择意见。这种缺乏机构的限制与关注建模好奇驱动学习的LPH理论不一致。我们在这里研究了这种选择可能性的引入如何影响学习效率和动机。给定的选择与练习难度正交的维度有关，作为一种有趣的特性。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过结合机器学习和学生选择，改进了智能辅导系统的性能和动机。使用ZPDES算法，该系统能够最大化学习进展，并在实地研究中提高了不同学生群体的学习成绩。研究还探讨了学生选择对学习效率和动机的影响。",

The ZPDES algorithm maximizes learning progress and has been shown to boost learning performances for diverse student populations. The study also investigates the impact of student choice on learning efficiency and motivation."
