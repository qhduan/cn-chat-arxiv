    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于LLM的代理引起了广泛关注，但其可信度仍未得到深入探索。由于代理可以直接与物理环境交互，其可靠性和安全性至关重要。本文提出了一种基于代理构成的代理框架TrustAgent，对LLM代理的安全性维度进行了初步研究。该框架包括三种策略：预先规划策略，在生成计划之前向模型注入安全知识；规划过程中策略，在生成计划时增强安全性；计划后检查策略，通过计划后检查确保安全性。通过实验分析，我们展示了这些方法如何通过识别和预防潜在危险有效提高LLM代理的安全性。此外，我们还探讨了安全性与使用者满意度之间的复杂关系，以及模型的推理能力与其效率之间的关联。",
