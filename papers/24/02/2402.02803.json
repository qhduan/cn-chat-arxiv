To tackle these issues, we harness the powerful semantic comprehension and input-agnostic characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs).

    "translated_abstract": "药物推荐是智能医疗系统中的重要方面，它根据患者特定的健康需求来推荐最合适的药物。然而，目前使用的许多复杂模型往往忽视医学数据的细微语义，而只是过度依赖标识。此外，这些模型在处理首次访问医院的患者的情况时面临重大挑战，因为它们缺乏之前的处方历史可以参考。为了解决这些问题，我们利用大型语言模型（LLMs）强大的语义理解和输入不可知的特性。我们的研究旨在利用LLMs改进现有的药物推荐方法。在本文中，我们介绍了一种新颖的方法，称为大型语言模型蒸馏药物推荐（LEADER）。我们首先创建合适的提示模板，使LLMs能够有效地推荐药物。",
