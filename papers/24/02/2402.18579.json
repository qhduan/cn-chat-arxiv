    "translated_abstract": "常数虚警率（CFAR）检测算法广泛应用于目前SAR图像中检测船只目标，这些算法基于各种统计分布，如高斯分布、Gamma分布、Weibull分布、对数正态分布、G0分布、alpha稳定分布等。然而，SAR图像中的杂散背景复杂多变。当实际杂散背景偏离假定的统计分布时，参数化CFAR检测器的性能将下降。除了参数化CFAR方案，还有另一类非参数化CFAR检测器，可以在没有已知杂波分布的假设情况下保持目标检测的恒定虚警率。在这项工作中，提出并分析了用于SAR图像中船只检测的Wilcoxon非参数化CFAR方案，并推导了Wilcoxon非参数检测器的虚警率的封闭形式以确定",
