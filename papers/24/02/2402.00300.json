However, existing work typically focuses on image-based SSL algorithms and visual capabilities that can be learned from static images (e.g. object recognition), thus ignoring temporal aspects of the world.

    "translated_abstract": "儿童通过几年的自我视觉经验学习到了强大的世界内部模型。这些内部模型能否通过儿童的视觉体验和通用的自监督学习算法来学习，还是需要强大的归纳偏差？最近，在收集大规模、纵向的发展现实视频数据集以及通用的自监督学习算法的进展使我们能够开始探讨这个本质与养育之间的问题。然而，现有的工作通常关注基于图像的自监督学习算法和可以从静态图像中学习的视觉能力（例如目标识别），从而忽略了世界的时间性质。为了弥合这一差距，我们在一个儿童早期发展阶段（6-31个月）从儿童的头戴式摄像记录中训练自监督视频模型。所得到的模型在促进从少量样本中学习行动概念方面非常有效。",
