    "translated_abstract": "对话中的讽刺解释（SED）是一项新而具有挑战性的任务，旨在为涉及多种模态（即话语、视频和音频）的讽刺对话生成自然语言解释。尽管现有的研究基于生成式预训练语言模型BART取得了巨大成功，但它们忽视了话语、视频和音频中存在的情感，而这些情感是讽刺解释中的重要线索。事实上，由于以下三个主要挑战：1）话语记号对情感的多样效应；2）视频音频情感信号与BART的嵌入空间之间的差距；3）话语、话语情感和视频音频情感之间的不同关系，将情感融入以提升SED性能是一项非常复杂的任务。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的基于图的增强情感的多模态讽刺解释框架，命名为EDGE。",
