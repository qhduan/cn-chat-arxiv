    "translated_abstract": "随着深度神经网络(DNNs)在许多计算问题上成为主要解决方案，航空业希望探索它们在减轻飞行员负担和改善运营安全方面的潜力。然而，在这类安全关键应用中使用DNNs需要进行彻底的认证过程。这一需求可以通过形式验证来解决，形式验证提供了严格的保证，例如证明某些误判的不存在。在本文中，我们使用Airbus当前正在开发的图像分类器DNN作为案例研究，旨在在飞机滑行阶段使用。我们使用形式方法来评估这个DNN对三种常见图像扰动类型的鲁棒性：噪声、亮度和对比度，以及它们的部分组合。这个过程涉及多次调用底层验证器，这可能在计算上是昂贵的；因此，我们提出了一种利用单调性的方法。",
