    "translated_abstract": "科学出版物的指数增长对人类研究者构成了严峻挑战。它迫使研究者将注意力集中在更狭窄的子领域上，使得发现其他领域的新颖且有影响力的研究想法和合作变得困难。虽然有办法预测科学论文未来的引用次数，但通常需要等到研究完成并且论文写成后才能进行评估，这样就错过了想法构思的早期阶段。在本文中，我们展示了如何预测从未被研究者发布的想法的影响力。为此，我们开发了一个大型的演化知识图谱，其中包含超过2100万篇科学论文。它结合了从论文内容中创建的语义网络和从历史引用中创建的影响网络。利用机器学习，我们可以高准确度地预测演化网络的动态情况，从而预测新的研究方向的影响力。我们预期这种能力将有助于研究者发现具有高影响力的研究主题。",
