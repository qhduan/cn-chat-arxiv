    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一个多智能体模拟器，用于由异质家庭、异质公司、中央银行和政府代理组成的经济系统，该系统可以受到外生的随机冲击。代理之间的互动定义了经济中商品的生产和消费以及资金的流动。每个代理可以根据固定的、规则性的策略行动，也可以通过与模拟器中其他代理的互动来学习自己的策略。我们通过选择基于经济文献的代理异质性参数，并将其行动空间设计与美国的实际数据相一致，来使我们的模拟器具备现实基础。我们的模拟器通过为经济系统定义 OpenAI Gym 风格的环境，促进了代理使用强化学习策略的能力。通过模拟和分析两种假设的（但有趣的）经济情景，我们展示了我们模拟器的实用性。",
