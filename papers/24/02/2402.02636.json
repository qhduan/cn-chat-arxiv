By contrast, systems, such as causal models, that learn abstract variables and causal relationships can demonstrate increased robustness against changes in the distribution. One reason for this success is the existence and use of Independent Causal Mechanisms (ICMs) representing high-level concepts that only sparsely interact.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在语言建模和复杂推理任务中表现出色，但在不常见的环境设置或分布变化的任务中，LLMs的泛化能力仍然不足。目前通常通过增加训练数据来缓解这个问题。然而，这种方法是脆弱的，因为任务的范围可能无法预测或可能会发生变化，并且使用新数据更新模型通常需要大量的额外训练。相反，那些学习抽象变量和因果关系的系统，如因果模型，可以表现出对分布变化的更强稳健性。其中一个原因是存在并使用独立因果机制（ICMs），表示只稀疏交互的高层概念。在这项工作中，我们应用因果性的两个概念，在LLMs中学习ICMs。我们开发了一个由多个稀疏交互的语言模型组成的新LLM架构。",
