    "translated_abstract": "数据合成被认为是一种利用数据同时保护数据隐私的重要方法。已经提出了大量的表格数据合成算法（我们称之为合成器）。一些合成器满足差分隐私，而其他一些则旨在以启发式的方式提供隐私保护。由于缺乏原则性评估指标以及对利用扩散模型和最新的基于边际的合成器与大型语言模型进行面对面比较的新开发的合成器的理解尚不全面，对这些合成器的优势和弱点的全面了解仍然难以实现。在本文中，我们提出了一个原则性和系统化的评估框架来评估表格数据合成算法。具体而言，我们检查和批评现有的评估指标，并引入了一组新的指标，以解决其限制，包括保真度、隐私性和实用性。基于提出的指标，我们还设计了一个统一的评估组织框架，以对不同算法进行评估并进行比较和总结。",
