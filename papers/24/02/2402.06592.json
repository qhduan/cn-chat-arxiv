We explore the uncommon words accuracy improvement when we use the new model and/or shallow fusion with context language model. We found that combination of both provides cumulative gain in uncommon words recognition accuracy.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于转录器的新颖神经网络架构，为ASR系统添加了上下文信息流。我们的方法在提高识别不常见单词的准确性的同时不影响常见单词的错误率。我们探索了当我们使用新模型和/或与上下文语言模型浅度融合时，对不常见单词准确性的改善。我们发现两者的组合可以累积提高不常见单词的识别准确性。",
