    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了SMUTF，一种用于大规模表格数据模式匹配的独特方法，该方法假设在开放域任务中，监督学习不会影响性能，从而实现了有效的跨域匹配。这个系统独特地结合了基于规则的特征工程、预训练语言模型和生成式大语言模型。受人道主义交换语言的启发，我们使用“生成标签”为每个数据列部署了创新的适应性，提高了模式匹配的效果。SMUTF具有广泛的灵活性，可以与任何现有的预训练嵌入、分类方法和生成模型无缝配合使用。鉴于模式匹配缺乏广泛的公开数据集，我们已经创建并开源了HDXSM数据集，该数据集来自公共人道主义数据，我们相信这是目前最全面的模式匹配数据集。",
