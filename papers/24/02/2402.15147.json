    "translated_abstract": "APT（高级持续性威胁）具有持久性、隐秘性和多样性等特征，是对网络基础设施的最大威胁之一。 为应对此威胁，现有研究利用溯源图来捕捉主机中系统实体之间的复杂关系，实现有效的APT检测。 与大多数现有工作只检测单个攻击事件不同，理解组织和完成APT攻击活动所应用的战术/技术（例如，Kill-Chain、ATT&CK）对安全运营更为重要。 现有研究尝试手动设计一组规则，将低级系统事件映射到高级APT战术/技术。 但基于规则的方法粗粒度且缺乏泛化能力，因此只能识别APT战术，无法辨识细粒度的APT技术和突变的APT攻击。 本文提出了TREC，这是首个尝试认知AP",
