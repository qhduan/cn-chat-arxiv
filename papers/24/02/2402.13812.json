Predicting mortality rates in HF patients, in particular, is difficult yet critical, necessitating individualized care, proactive management, and enabling educated decision-making to enhance outcomes. Recently, the significance of voice biomarkers coupled with Machine Learning (ML) has surged, demonstrating remarkable efficacy, particularly in predicting heart failure. The synergy of voice analysis and ML algorithms provides a non-invasive and easily accessible means to evaluate patients' health.

    "translated_abstract": "应对心力衰竭作为一种普遍存在的全球健康问题，实施创新方法以增强患者护理存在困难。特别是在心力衰竭患者中预测死亡率既困难又关键，需要个性化护理、积极管理，并支持知情决策以增强结果。最近，声音生物标志物与机器学习（ML）相结合的重要性日益突出，特别在预测心力衰竭方面表现出显著有效性。声音分析与ML算法的协同作用提供了一种非侵入式且易于获取的评估患者健康状况的方法。然而，针对符合标准化语音协议的心力衰竭患者预测死亡率缺乏声音生物标志物。在这里，我们展示了一个强大有效的ML模型，通过利用声音生物标志物来预测住院心力衰竭患者的死亡率。",
