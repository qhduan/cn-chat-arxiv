    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）是分散式机器学习的重大突破，但面临诸多挑战，如数据可用性有限和计算资源的变化性，这可能会限制模型的性能和可伸缩性。将Foundation模型（FM）集成到FL中，可以解决这些问题，通过预训练和数据增强增加数据丰富性并减少计算需求。然而，这种集成引入了鲁棒性、隐私和公平性方面的新问题，在现有研究中尚未得到充分解决。我们通过系统评估FM-FL集成对这些方面的影响，进行了初步调查。我们分析了其中的权衡取舍，揭示了该集成引入的威胁和问题，并提出了一套用于应对这些挑战的标准和策略。此外，我们还鉴定了可能解决这些问题的一些前景方向和研究方向。",
