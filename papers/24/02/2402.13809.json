    "translated_abstract": "基于潜在扩散模型(LDM)从功能性磁共振成像(fMRI)中重建视觉刺激，为大脑提供了细粒度的检索。一个挑战在于重建细节的连贯对齐（如结构、背景、纹理、颜色等）。此外，即使在相同条件下，LDM也会生成不同的图像结果。因此，我们首先揭示了基于LDM的神经科学视角，即基于来自海量图像的预训练知识进行自上而下的创建，但缺乏基于细节驱动的自下而上感知，导致细节不忠实。我们提出了NeuralDiffuser，引入主视觉特征引导，以渐变形式提供细节线索，扩展了LDM方法的自下而上过程，以实现忠实的语义和细节。我们还开发了一种新颖的引导策略，以确保重复重建的一致性，而不是随机性。",
