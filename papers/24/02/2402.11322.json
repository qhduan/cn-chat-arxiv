    "translated_abstract": "脉冲神经网络（SNN）为解决机器学习任务提供了实现超低功耗计算的有前途的解决方案。目前，大多数SNN架构都源自人工神经网络，其神经元的架构和操作与SNN不同，或者在不考虑来自底层处理硬件的内存预算的情况下开发。这些限制阻碍了SNN在准确性和效率方面充分发挥潜力。为此，我们提出了SpikeNAS，一种新颖的内存感知神经架构搜索（NAS）框架，可在给定内存预算下快速找到一个具有高准确性的适当SNN架构。为实现这一目标，我们的SpikeNAS采用了几个关键步骤：分析网络操作对准确性的影响，增强网络架构以提高学习质量，并开发快速内存感知搜索算法。",
