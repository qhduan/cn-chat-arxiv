    "translated_abstract": "我们将标准持久同调与图像持久同调相结合，定义了一种新颖的表征形状和它们之间相互作用的方法。具体而言，我们介绍了：（1）混合条形码，捕捉任意维度两个点集之间的几何-拓扑相互作用（混合）；（2）简单的总混合和总百分比混合统计量，作为一个单一数字来量化相互作用的复杂性；（3）一个用于操作上述工具的软件工具。作为一个概念验证，我们将该工具应用到一个源自机器学习的问题上。具体地，我们研究了不同类别嵌入的可分离性。结果表明，拓扑混合是一种用于表征低维和高维数据交互的有效方法。与持久同调的典型用法相比，这个新工具对于拓扑特征的几何位置更为敏感，这通常是可取的。",
