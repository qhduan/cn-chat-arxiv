    "abstract": "An October 2023 crash between a GM Cruise robotaxi and a pedestrian in San Francisco resulted not only in a severe injury, but also dramatic upheaval at that company that will likely have lasting effects throughout the industry. The issues stem not just from the crash facts themselves, but also how Cruise mishandled dealing with their robotaxi dragging a pedestrian under the vehicle after the initial post-crash stop. A pair of external investigation reports provide raw material describing the incident and critique the company response from a regulatory interaction point of view, but did not include potential safety recommendations in scope. We use that report material to highlight specific facts and relationships between events by tying together different pieces of the report material. We then explore safety lessons that might be learned with regard to technology, operational safety practices, and organizational reaction to incidents.",

    "translated_abstract": "2023年10月，在旧金山，一辆通用汽车Cruise的机器人出租车与一名行人相撞，造成了严重的伤害，同时也对该公司造成了巨大的动荡，这很可能会对整个行业产生长期影响。问题不仅仅源于事故本身，还包括Cruise在处理机器人出租车撞到行人后被拖行的过程中的失误。两份外部调查报告提供了描述事件的原始材料，并从监管互动的角度批评了公司的反应，但并未包含潜在的安全建议。我们利用这些报告材料来强调具体的事实和事件之间的关系，通过将报告材料的不同部分联系起来。然后我们探讨在技术、操作安全实践和组织对事件的反应方面可能可以学到的安全教训。",
