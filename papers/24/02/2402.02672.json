    "translated_abstract": "在医学和社会科学等各个领域中，对条件平均治疗效果（CATEs）的估计是一个重要的课题。如果分布在多个参与方之间的数据可以集中，可以对CATEs进行高精度的估计。然而，如果这些数据包含隐私信息，则很难进行数据聚合。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了数据协作双机器学习（DC-DML）方法，该方法可以在保护分布式数据隐私的情况下估计CATE模型，并通过数值实验对该方法进行了评估。我们的贡献总结如下三点。首先，我们的方法能够在分布式数据上进行非迭代通信的半参数CATE模型的估计和测试。半参数或非参数的CATE模型能够比参数模型更稳健地进行估计和测试，对于模型偏差的鲁棒性更强。然而，据我们所知，目前还没有提出有效的通信方法来估计和测试这些模型。",
