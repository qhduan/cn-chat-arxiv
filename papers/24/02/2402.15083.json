    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种名为Hands-Free VR的基于语音的自然语言虚拟现实界面。用户可以通过语音发出命令，其语音音频数据经过一个针对单词音素相似性和英语口音的鲁棒性进行微调的语音识别深度学习模型转换为文本，然后利用一个对自然语言多样性具有鲁棒性的大型语言模型将文本映射为可执行的虚拟现实命令。Hands-Free VR在一个受控的被试研究中（N = 22）进行了评估，要求参与者找到特定物体并以各种配置放置它们。在对照条件下，参与者使用传统的虚拟现实用户界面通过手持控制器抓取、搬运和定位物体。在实验条件下，参与者使用Hands-Free VR。结果表明：（1）Hands-Free VR对英语口音具有鲁棒性，因为在我们的20名参与者中，英语不是他们的首选语言。",
