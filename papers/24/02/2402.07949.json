    "translated_abstract": "糖尿病是一种慢性疾病，影响美国境内有3800万人，它会影响身体将食物转化为能量（即血糖）的能力。标准的治疗方法是通过使用人工胰腺，即持续胰岛素泵（基础注射），以及定期注射胰岛素（突发注射）来补充碳水化合物摄入量。治疗目标是将血糖保持在可接受范围的中心位置，通过持续血糖测量来进行衡量。次要目标是减少注射次数，因为对某些患者来说注射是不愉快且难以实施的。本研究使用神经进化来发现治疗的最佳策略。基于30天的治疗和单个患者的测量数据集，首先训练了随机森林来预测未来的血糖水平。然后通过进化了一个神经网络来指定碳水化合物摄入量、基础注射水平和突发注射。进化发现了一个帕累托前沿，减少了与目标值的偏差。",
