    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.12327v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements have shown that agents powered by large language models (LLMs) possess capabilities to simulate human behaviors and societal dynamics. However, the potential for LLM agents to spontaneously establish collaborative relationships in the absence of explicit instructions has not been studied. To address this gap, we conduct three case studies, revealing that LLM agents are capable of spontaneously forming collaborations even within competitive settings. This finding not only demonstrates the capacity of LLM agents to mimic competition and cooperation in human societies but also validates a promising vision of computational social science. Specifically, it suggests that LLM agents could be utilized to model human social interactions, including those with spontaneous collaborations, thus offering insights into social phenomena.

    "translated_title": "我们应该交流吗：探索竞争LLM代理之间的自发合作",
    "translated_abstract": "最近的进展表明，由大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动的代理具有模拟人类行为和社会动态的能力。然而，尚未研究LLM代理在没有明确指令的情况下自发建立合作关系的潜力。为了弥补这一空白，我们进行了三项案例研究，揭示了LLM代理甚至在竞争环境中也能自发形成合作关系的能力。这一发现不仅展示了LLM代理模拟人类社会中竞争与合作的能力，也验证了计算社会科学的一个有前途的愿景。具体来说，这表明LLM代理可以用于建模人类社会互动，包括那些自发合作的互动，从而提供对社会现象的洞察。这项研究的源代码可在https://github.com/wuzengqing001225/SABM_ShallWe 找到。",
