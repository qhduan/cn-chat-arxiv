Recent approaches are proposed to represent KG entities and logical queries into embedding vectors and find answers to logical queries from the KGs.

    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱中的复杂逻辑查询答案是一个具有挑战性的任务，已经得到广泛研究。执行复杂逻辑推理的能力是必不可少的，并支持各种基于图推理的下游任务，比如搜索引擎。最近提出了一些方法，将知识图谱实体和逻辑查询表示为嵌入向量，并从知识图谱中找到逻辑查询的答案。然而，现有的方法主要集中在查询单个知识图谱上，并不能应用于多个图形。此外，直接共享带有敏感信息的知识图谱可能会带来隐私风险，使得共享和构建一个聚合知识图谱用于推理以检索查询答案是不切实际的。因此，目前仍然不清楚如何在多源知识图谱上回答查询。一个实体可能涉及到多个知识图谱，对多个知识图谱进行推理，并在多源知识图谱上回答复杂查询对于发现知识是重要的。",
