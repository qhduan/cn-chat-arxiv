    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.10725v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The global food delivery market provides many opportunities for AI-based services that can improve the efficiency of feeding the world. This paper presents the Cloud Kitchen platform as a decision-making tool for restaurants with food delivery and a simulator to evaluate the impact of the decisions. The platform consists of a Technology-Specific Bridge (TSB) that provides an interface for communicating with restaurants or the simulator. TSB uses a PDDL model to represent decisions embedded in the Unified Planning Framework (UPF). Decision-making, which concerns allocating customers' orders to vehicles and deciding in which order the customers will be served (for each vehicle), is done via a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), an efficient tool for this problem. We show that decisions made by our platform can improve customer satisfaction by reducing the number of delayed deliveries using a real-world historical dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "全球食品配送市场为基于人工智能的服务提供了许多机会，可以提高全球供餐效率。本文介绍了Cloud Kitchen平台，作为一个决策工具，用于帮助具有食品配送服务的餐厅，并提供一个模拟器来评估决策的影响。该平台由一个Technology-Specific Bridge（TSB）组成，用于与餐厅或模拟器进行通信。TSB使用PDDL模型表示嵌入在Unified Planning Framework（UPF）中的决策。决策涉及将顾客订单分配到车辆以及决定以什么顺序为顾客提供服务（对于每辆车），这是通过具有时间窗口的车辆路径问题（VRPTW）来完成的，这个问题的解决是高效的。我们展示了我们平台制定的决策可以通过使用真实历史数据集减少延迟配送量来提高顾客满意度。",
