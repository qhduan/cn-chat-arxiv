    "translated_abstract": "区块链联邦学习（FL）在确保FL过程的完整性和可追溯性方面越来越受到关注。区块链FL涉及参与者在本地训练模型并随后将模型发布到区块链上，形成表示模型关系的类似有向无环图（DAG）的继承结构。然而，这种基于DAG的结构在使用敏感数据更新模型时存在挑战，因为涉及的复杂性和开销较大。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了基于区块链的联邦遗忘（BlockFUL），这是一个通用框架，使用变色龙哈希（CH）技术重新设计区块链结构，以减轻模型更新的复杂性，从而降低遗忘任务的计算和共识成本。此外，BlockFUL支持各种联邦遗忘方法，确保模型更新的完整性和可追溯性。",
