    "translated_abstract": "LLMs已经展示出在不同领域取得了令人瞩目的性能。然而，为了有效指导LLMs制定高质量的提示对于非AI专家来说是一个挑战。现有的提示工程研究建议了一些略显零碎的优化原则和设计，以及凭经验依赖的提示优化器。不幸的是，这些努力缺乏一个结构化的设计模板，导致学习成本高，重复使用性低。受结构化可重复使用的编程语言的启发，我们提出了LangGPT，作为LLMs的编程语言的双层提示设计框架。LangGPT具有易于学习的规范结构，并提供了一个扩展结构以进行迁移和重用。实验证明，与基准相比，LangGPT显著增强了LLMs产生高质量响应的能力。此外，LangGPT已被证明在引导LLMs生成高质量提示方面是有效的。",
