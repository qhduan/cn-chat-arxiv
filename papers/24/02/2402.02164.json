    "translated_abstract": "字符串基本的分子表示方法，如SMILES，在线性表示分子信息方面是事实上的标准。然而，必须使用配对符号和解析算法导致了长的语法依赖关系，使得即使是最先进的深度学习模型也难以准确理解语法和语义。尽管DeepSMILES和SELFIES已经解决了某些限制，但它们仍然在处理高级语法方面存在困难，使得一些字符串难以阅读。本研究引入了一个补充算法TSIS（TSID简化），用于t-SMILES家族。TSIS与另一个基于片段的线性解决方案SAFE进行了比较实验，结果表明SAFE在处理语法中的长期依赖性时存在挑战。TSIS继续使用t-SMILES中定义的树作为其基础数据结构，这使其与SAFE模型有所不同。TSIS模型的性能超过了SAFE模型，表明t-SMILES的树结构起到了重要作用。",
