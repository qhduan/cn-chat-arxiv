    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了DyExpert，一种用于跨域链接预测的动态图模型。它可以明确地建模历史演化过程，学习特定下游图的演化模式，并进而进行特定模式的链接预测。DyExpert采用了解码器优化的transformer，并通过结合演化建模和链接预测的“条件链接生成”实现了高效的并行训练和推断。DyExpert在包含6百万个动态边的广泛动态图上进行训练。在八个未训练的图上进行了大量实验，结果显示DyExpert在跨域链接预测中取得了最先进的性能。与相同设置下的先进基准相比，DyExpert在八个图上的平均精确度提高了11.40％。更令人印象深刻的是，在六个未训练的图上，它超过了八个先进基线的全监督性能。",
