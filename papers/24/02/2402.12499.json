    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了针对IT基础设施的自动化安全响应，并将攻击者和防御者之间的互动形式表述为一个部分观测、非平稳博弈。我们放宽了游戏模型正确规定的标准假设，并考虑每个参与者对模型有一个概率性猜想，可能在某种意义上错误规定，即真实模型的概率为0。这种形式允许我们捕捉关于基础设施和参与者意图的不确定性。为了在线学习有效的游戏策略，我们设计了一种新颖的方法，其中一个参与者通过贝叶斯学习迭代地调整其猜想，并通过推演更新其策略。我们证明了猜想会收敛到最佳拟合，并提供了在具有猜测模型的情况下推演实现性能改进的上限。为了刻画游戏的稳定状态，我们提出了Berk-Nash平衡的一个变种。",
