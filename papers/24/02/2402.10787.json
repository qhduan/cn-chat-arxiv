    "translated_abstract": "尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在各个领域取得了显著进展，但由于其庞大的参数和计算量，LLMs在边缘设备上的广泛应用受到限制。为了解决这一问题，通常采用量化方法生成具有高效计算和快速推理的轻量级LLMs。然而，后训练量化（PTQ）方法在将权重、激活和KV缓存一起量化至8位以下时，质量会急剧下降。此外，许多量化感知训练（QAT）工作对模型权重进行量化，而激活未被触及，这不能充分发挥量化对边缘端推理加速的潜力。在本文中，我们提出了EdgeQAT，即熵和分布引导的QAT，用于优化轻量级LLMs以实现在边缘设备上的推理加速。我们首先确定量化性能下降主要源自信息",
