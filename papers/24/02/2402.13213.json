    "translated_abstract": "尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在许多任务上表现出色，但过度自信仍然是一个问题。我们假设在多项选择问答任务中，错误答案将与最大softmax概率（MSPs）较小相关，相比之下正确答案较大。我们在十个开源LLMs和五个数据集上全面评估了这一假设，在表现良好的原始问答任务中发现了对我们假设的强有力证据。对于表现最佳的六个LLMs，从MSP导出的AUROC在59/60个实例中都优于随机机会，p < 10^{-4}。在这六个LLMs中，平均AUROC范围在60%至69%之间。利用这些发现，我们提出了一个带有弃权选项的多项选择问答任务，并展示通过根据初始模型响应的MSP有选择地弃权可以提高性能。我们还用预softmax logits而不是softmax进行了相同的实验。",
