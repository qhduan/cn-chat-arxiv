SymbolicAI enables the seamless integration of generative models with a diverse range of solvers by treating large language models (LLMs) as semantic parsers that execute tasks based on both natural and formal language instructions, thus bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning and generative AI. We leverage probabilistic programming principles to tackle complex tasks, and utilize differentiable and classical programming paradigms with their respective strengths. The framework introduces a set of polymorphic, compositional, and self-referential operations for data stream manipulation, aligning LLM outputs with user objectives. As a result, we can transition between the capabilities of various foundation models endowed with zero- and few-shot learning capabilities and specialized, fine-tuned models or solvers proficient in addres",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了SymbolicAI，这是一个多功能且模块化的框架，采用基于逻辑的方法来处理生成过程中的概念学习和流程管理。SymbolicAI通过将大型语言模型（LLM）作为语义解析器来执行基于自然语言和形式语言指令的任务，从而弥合了符号推理和生成式人工智能之间的差距，使生成模型与各种求解器无缝集成。我们利用概率编程原理来处理复杂任务，并利用可微分和经典编程范 paradigms 的各自优势。该框架引入了一系列多态的、组合的和自指的数据流操作，将LLM的输出与用户的目标对齐。因此，我们可以在具有零次和少次学习能力的各种基础模型之间进行过渡，并与擅长解决特定问题的专业化调优模型或求解器配合使用。",
