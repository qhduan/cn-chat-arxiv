    "translated_abstract": "大学生常常花费大量时间向管理员或教师寻求常见问题的答案。这对双方来说都很繁琐，需要找到一个解决方案。为此，本文提出了一个聊天机器人模型，利用自然语言处理和深度学习技术，在阿姆哈拉语中回答常见问题。聊天机器人是通过人工智能模拟人类对话的计算机程序，作为虚拟助手处理问题和其他任务。所提出的聊天机器人程序使用标记化、规范化、去除停用词和词干提取对阿姆哈拉语输入句子进行分析和分类。采用了三种机器学习模型算法来分类标记和检索合适的回答：支持向量机（SVM）、多项式朴素贝叶斯和通过TensorFlow、Keras和NLTK实现的深度神经网络。深度学习模型取得了最好的成绩。",
