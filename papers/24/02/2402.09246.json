    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑计算多智能体空间导航问题的社会最优行动顺序的问题，即智能体决策顺序，以及与之相关的N人Stackelberg轨迹博弈的均衡。我们将这个问题建模为一个混合整数优化问题，涉及到所有可能的行动顺序的Stackelberg博弈空间。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了Branch and Play (B&P)，这是一个高效且准确的算法，可以收敛到社会最优行动顺序及其Stackelberg均衡。作为B&P的一个子例程，我们提出并扩展了顺序轨迹规划，即一种流行的多智能体控制方法，以便为任何给定的行动顺序可扩展地计算有效的本地Stackelberg均衡。我们证明了B&P在协调空中交通控制、群体形成和交付车队方面的实际效用。我们发现B&P的结果是一致的。",
