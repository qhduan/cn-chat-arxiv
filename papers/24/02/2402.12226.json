    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了 AnyGPT，这是一个任意多模式语言模型，利用离散表示统一处理各种模态，包括语音、文本、图像和音乐。AnyGPT 可以稳定训练，无需对当前大型语言模型（LLM）架构或训练范式进行任何改动。相反，它仅依赖于数据级预处理，促进了新模态的无缝集成到LLM中，类似于新语言的整合。我们构建了一个多模式文本中心的数据集，用于多模式对齐预训练。利用生成模型，我们合成了第一个大规模任意多模式指令数据集。它包括108k个多轮对话示例，精细地交织各种模态，从而使模型能够处理多模态输入和输出的任意组合。实验结果表明，AnyGPT能够促进...",
