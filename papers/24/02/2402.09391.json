    "translated_abstract": "化学在药物研发和材料科学等许多领域中起着至关重要的作用。尽管诸如GPT-4之类的大型语言模型（LLM）在自然语言处理任务上展现出了非凡的能力，但现有工作表明它们在化学任务上的性能令人失望。然而，在本文中，我们展示了我们开发的LLM在一系列化学任务上可以取得非常强大的结果，在所有任务上都显著优于最先进的GPT-4，并接近SoTA任务特定模型。我们取得成功的关键是一个名为SMolInstruct的大规模、全面、高质量的指令调优数据集。它包含了14个经过精心挑选的化学任务和超过三百万个高质量样本，为训练和评估化学LLM奠定了坚实基础。基于SMolInstruct，我们对一组开源LLM进行了微调，其中，我们发现Mistral ser是最佳性能的模型。",
