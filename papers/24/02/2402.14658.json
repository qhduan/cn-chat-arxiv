    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型的引入显著推动了代码生成的发展。然而，开源模型通常缺乏类似GPT-4 Code Interpreter这样的高级系统的执行能力和迭代细化能力。为了解决这一问题，我们介绍了OpenCodeInterpreter，这是一族旨在生成、执行和迭代细化代码的开源代码系统。通过Code-Feedback支持，该系统集成了执行和人类反馈，用于动态代码细化。我们对OpenCodeInterpreter在诸如HumanEval、MBPP以及它们来自EvalPlus的增强版本等关键基准上进行了全面评估，证实了其出色的性能。值得注意的是，OpenCodeInterpreter-33B在HumanEval和MBPP的平均值（以及其增强版本）上取得了83.2（76.4）的准确率，与GPT-4的84.2（76.2）紧密匹敌，并且通过合成hum",
