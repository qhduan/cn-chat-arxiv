Prior studies revealed gender biases in single-person image generation, but T2I model applications might require portraying two or more people simultaneously. Potential biases in this setting remain unexplored, leading to fairness-related risks in usage. To study these underlying facets of gender biases in T2I models, we propose a novel Paired Stereotype Test (PST) bias evaluation framework. PST prompts the model to generate two individuals in the same image. They are described with two social identities that are stereotypically associated with the opposite gender. Biases can then be measured by the level of conformation to gender stereotypes in generated images. Using PST, we evaluate DALLE-3 from 2 perspectives: biases in gendered occupation and biases in organizational power.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近大规模的文本到图像（T2I）模型（如DALLE-3）展示了在新应用中的巨大潜力，但也面临前所未有的公平挑战。先前的研究揭示了单人图像生成中的性别偏见，但T2I模型应用可能需要同时描绘两个或更多人。该设定中的潜在偏见仍未被探究，导致使用中的公平相关风险。为了研究T2I模型中性别偏见的基本方面，我们提出了一种新颖的成对刻板印象测试（PST）偏见评估框架。PST促使模型生成同一图像中的两个个体，用与相反性别刻板印象相关联的两个社会身份来描述他们。通过生成的图像遵从性别刻板印象的程度来衡量偏见。利用PST，我们从两个角度评估DALLE-3：性别职业中的偏见和组织权力中的偏见。",
