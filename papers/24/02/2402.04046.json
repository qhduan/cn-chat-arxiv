    "translated_abstract": "图生成是各种工程和科学学科的基础。然而，现有的方法往往忽视了边属性的生成。然而，我们确定了一些关键应用中边属性的重要性，这使得先前的方法在这些情境中可能不适用。此外，虽然存在一些简单的适应方法，但经验调查显示它们的效果有限，因为它们没有很好地模拟图组件之间的相互作用。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个节点和边的联合评分模型，用于图形生成，考虑了所有图组件。我们的方法具有两个关键创新点：(i) 将节点和边属性结合在一个注意模块中，基于这两个因素生成样本；(ii) 在图形扩散过程中，节点、边和邻接信息相互依赖。我们在涉及实际和合成数据集的具有挑战性的基准测试中评估了我们的方法，其中包含边特征。",
