    "translated_abstract": "人工智能具有从大量关于学生学习模式的数据中发现洞察力的潜力，有望改变教育。然而，人工智能的伦理和信任问题已经引起了关注，但尚未解决。在高中人工智能教育中，突出的伦理问题包括数据隐私、信息泄露、滥用语言和公平性。本文描述了为解决高中学生与人工智能协作解决魔方的伦理和信任问题而构建的技术组件（称为ALLURE chatbot）。在数据隐私方面，我们希望确保儿童、父母和教师的知情同意处于任何管理的数据的中心位置。由于涉及儿童，系统能够接受用户和人工智能提供的文本、音频或视觉语言，并将互动引导远离危险情况。在信息管理方面，我们还希望确保系统可以利用机制防止信息泄露的危险。",
