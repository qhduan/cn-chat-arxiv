    "translated_abstract": "人类学习对规则结构和训练中所使用的示例课程非常敏感。在由简洁规则控制的任务中，当相关示例在多次试验中被分组时，学习更加稳健；但在缺乏这样的规则的情况下，交错训练更加有效。迄今为止，没有神经模型能够同时捕捉到这些看似矛盾的效应。在本文中，我们展示了“上下文学习”（ICL）在使用元学习进行训练的神经网络和大型语言模型（LLMs）中自发产生了同样的权衡。ICL是通过内层循环算法在激活动力学中实现的一种“上下文内学习”（in-context learning）的能力，可以在没有权重更改的情况下学习新任务。对预训练的LLMs和元学习变压器进行的实验表明，ICL在涉及规则结构的任务中展示出了人类所示的分组优势，而同时进行权重学习则复制了人类在缺少这样结构的任务上所观察到的交错优势。",
