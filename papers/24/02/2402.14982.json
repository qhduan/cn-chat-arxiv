    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.14982v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: In this paper we study the variations in human brain activity when listening to real and fake audio. Our preliminary results suggest that the representations learned by a state-of-the-art deepfake audio detection algorithm, do not exhibit clear distinct patterns between real and fake audio. In contrast, human brain activity, as measured by EEG, displays distinct patterns when individuals are exposed to fake versus real audio. This preliminary evidence enables future research directions in areas such as deepfake audio detection.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了人类听取真实和虚假音频时大脑活动的变化。我们的初步结果表明，一种最先进的深度伪造音频检测算法所学习的表示，并没有显示出真实和虚假音频之间的清晰不同模式。相反，人类大脑活动，通过 EEG 测量，在个体接触虚假与真实音频时显示出不同的模式。这些初步证据为未来在深度伪造音频检测等领域提供了研究方向。",
