    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱（KGs）上的复杂查询回答（CQA）是一项具有挑战性的任务。由于KGs通常是不完整的，提出了神经模型来通过执行多跳逻辑推理来解决CQA。然而，大多数模型不能同时在一跳和多跳查询上表现良好。最近的工作提出了一种基于预训练神经链接预测器的逻辑消息传递机制。虽然在一跳和多跳查询上都有效，但它忽略了查询图中常量和变量节点之间的差异。此外，在节点嵌入更新阶段，该机制不能动态衡量不同消息的重要性，并且它能否捕捉与节点和接收消息相关的隐式逻辑依赖关系仍不清楚。在本文中，我们提出了条件逻辑消息传递变压器（CLMPT），考虑了查询图中常量和变量之间的差异，并且具有动态测量不同消息重要性以及捕捉与节点和接收消息相关的隐式逻辑依赖关系的能力。",
