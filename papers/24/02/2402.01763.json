    "abstract": "The recent burst in Large Language Models has opened new frontiers in human-like text processing and generation. However, alongside their remarkable growth, Large Language Models have encountered critical challenges including issues of hallucination, bias, real-time knowledge updates, and the high costs of implementation and maintenance in commercial settings. Vector Databases, another increasingly popular tool, offer potential solutions to these challenges. These databases are adept at handling high-dimensional data and are crucial for tasks such as efficient information retrieval and semantic search. By integrating with Large Language Models, they significantly enhance AI systems' ability to manage and utilize diverse data more effectively. This survey paper provides an in-depth and unique analysis of the intersection between Large Language Models and Vector Databases.",
