Each satellite is an independent decision-making agent with a partial knowledge of the environment, and supported by feedback received from the nearby agents. Building on our previous work that introduced a Q-routing solution, the contribution of this paper is to extend it to a deep learning framework able to quickly adapt to the network and traffic changes, and based on two phases: (1) An offline exploration learning phase that relies on a global Deep Neural Network (DNN) to learn the optimal paths at each possible position and congestion level; (2) An online exploitation phase with local, on-board, pre-trained DNNs. Results show that MA-DRL efficiently learns optimal routes offline that are then loaded for an efficient distributed routing online.",
