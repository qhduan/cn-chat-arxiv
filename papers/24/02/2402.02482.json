    "translated_abstract": "我们重新审视了估计高维全球银行网络连通性的问题。与Demirer等人（2018）直接对实现的高维波动性向量进行正则化不同，我们估计了一个具有稀疏VAR特殊分量的动态因子模型。这样可以区分：（I）系统范围连通度（SWC）由共同成分冲击引起的部分（我们称之为“银行市场”），以及（II）由特殊冲击引起的部分（单个银行）。我们使用Demirer等人（2018）的原始数据集（每日数据，2003-2013）以及更新的数据集（2014-2023）。对于两者，我们计算由（I），（II），（I+II）产生的SWC，并提供自助法置信区间。与文献一致，我们发现SWC在全球危机期间猛增。然而，我们的方法将SWC低估的风险降至最低，这在高维数据集中，系统风险的发生可能既普遍又特殊的情况下至关重要。实际上，我们能够区分出...",

The study finds that system-wide connectedness (SWC) spikes during global crises, while the proposed method minimizes the risk of SWC underestimation."
