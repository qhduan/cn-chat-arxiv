    "translated_abstract": "深度学习提供了一种改进频谱访问技术的有希望的解决方案，通过利用数据驱动的方法来管理和共享有限的频谱资源，用于新兴应用。对于其中几种应用，敏感的无线数据（如频谱图）存储在共享数据库或多方利益相关者云环境中，因此容易造成隐私泄漏。本文旨在通过研究5G开放无线接入网络（O-RAN）中共享数据库场景的典型案例来解决此类隐私问题，在这些场景中，我们在近实时（near-RT）无线接入网络智能控制器中有一个共享数据库。我们着重讨论了如何保护用于频谱共享和干扰缓解应用的机器学习（ML）模型所使用的数据，同时不影响模型和网络的性能。其中的基本想法是利用基于洗牌的可学习加密技术来加密数据。",
