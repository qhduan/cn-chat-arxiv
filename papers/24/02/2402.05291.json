    "translated_abstract": "虽然冰盖和海平面系统模型（ISSM）的有限元方法可以快速准确地解决由Stokes方程描述的冰动力学问题，但这种数值建模需要在中央处理单元（CPU）上进行密集的计算。在本研究中，我们开发了图神经网络（GNN）作为快速代理模型来保持ISSM的有限元结构。利用Pine Island Glacier（PIG）的20年瞬态模拟，我们训练和测试了三个GNN：图卷积网络（GCN），图注意力网络（GAT）和等变图卷积网络（EGCN）。这些GNN与经典卷积神经网络（CNN）和多层感知器（MLP）相比，能够更准确地重现冰厚度和速度。特别是，在PIG中，GNN成功捕捉到了由更高底部熔化速率引起的冰质量损失和加速。当我们的GNN仿真器在图形处理单元（GPU）上实现时，它们显示出高达50倍的加速。",
