    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一个重复的贝叶斯说服问题（更一般地，任何具有完全信息的广义委托-代理问题），其中委托人没有承诺能力，代理人使用算法来学习如何对委托人的信号做出响应。我们将这个问题简化为一个一次性的广义委托-代理问题，代理人近似地最佳响应。通过这个简化，我们可以证明：如果代理人使用上下文无遗憾学习算法，则委托人可以保证其效用与经典无学习模型中具有承诺的委托人的最优效用之间可以无限接近；如果代理人使用上下文无交换遗憾学习算法，则委托人无法获得比具有承诺的无学习模型中的最优效用更高的效用。委托人在学习模型与非学习模型中可以获得的效用之间的差距是有界的。",
