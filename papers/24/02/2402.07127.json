    "translated_abstract": "机器人学习操作技能受到多样化、无偏的数据集的稀缺性的影响。尽管策划的数据集可以帮助解决问题，但在泛化性和现实世界的转移方面仍然存在挑战。与此同时，“野外”视频数据集的大规模存在通过自监督技术推动了计算机视觉的进展。将这一点应用到机器人领域，最近的研究探索了通过被动观察来学习丰富的在线视频中的操作技能。这种基于视频的学习范式显示出了有希望的结果，它提供了可扩展的监督方法，同时降低了数据集的偏见。本综述回顾了视频特征表示学习技术、物体可行性理解、三维手部/身体建模和大规模机器人资源等基础知识，以及从不受控制的视频演示中获取机器人操作技能的新兴技术。我们讨论了仅从观察大规模人类视频中学习如何增强机器人的泛化性和样本效率。",
