    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种基于kNN的回归方法，将传统的非参数kNN模型的可扩展性和适应性与一种新的变量选择技术相结合。该方法主要目标是准确估计随机响应变量的条件均值和方差，从而有效地描述各种情景下的条件分布。我们的方法包含了一个健壮的不确定性量化机制，利用我们之前关于条件均值和方差的估计工作。 kNN的应用确保了在预测区间时可扩展的计算效率和与最优非参数速率相一致的统计准确性。此外，我们引入了一种新的kNN半参数算法来估计考虑协变量的ROC曲线。对于选择平滑参数k，我们提出了一个具有理论保证的算法。变量选择的引入显著提高了该方法相对于传统方法的性能。",
