    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在执行数值计算时经常出错。与传统的思维链推理相比，程序化思维方法涉及生成可执行代码来解决问题。通过执行这些代码，它可以获得更精确的结果。使用生成的可执行代码而不是自然语言可以减少计算错误。然而，我们观察到当LLMs使用代码解决数学问题时，他们往往生成比使用自然语言更多的不正确推理。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了Human-Think Language（HTL），这是一种受到人类编码实践启发的简单而高效的方法。该方法首先由模型生成用自然语言描述的解决问题方法，然后将其转换为代码，反映出人们在将逻辑以自然语言形式思考后再将其写成代码的过程。此外，它利用了P",
