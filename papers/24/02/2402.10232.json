    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们提出了Johnson-Lindenstrauss（JL）引理的简单统一分析，这是处理高维数据至关重要的降维领域中的基石。我们的方法不仅简化了理解，还将各种构造统一到JL框架下，包括球形、高斯、二进制硬币和次高斯模型。这种简化和统一在保持数据固有几何的重要性方面取得了重大进展，对从流算法到强化学习等各种应用至关重要。值得注意的是，我们在这个简化框架内提出了球形构造有效性的第一个严格证明。我们贡献的核心是将Hanson-Wright不等式拓展到高维度，具有明确的常数，这标志着文献中质的飞跃。通过运用简单而强大的概率工具",
