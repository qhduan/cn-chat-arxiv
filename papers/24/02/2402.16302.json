    "translated_title": "图扩散策略优化",
    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究在优化扩散模型以实现特定下游目标方面取得了重要进展，这对于领域如药物设计中的图生成是一个重要的追求。然而，直接将这些模型应用于图扩散存在挑战，导致性能不佳。本文介绍了一种名为图扩散策略优化（GDPO）的新方法，该方法通过强化学习为任意（如非可微分）目标优化图扩散模型。GDPO基于针对图扩散模型量身定制的急切策略梯度，通过认真分析开发，有望提高性能。实验结果表明，GDPO在具有复杂和多样化目标的各种图生成任务中实现了最先进的性能。代码可在https://github.com/sail-sg/GDPO上找到。",
