    "translated_abstract": "本文提出并分析了一种通过深度神经网络近似随机微分方程（SDE）解的新方法。该结构灵感来自于深度算子网络（DeepONets）的概念，它基于函数空间中的算子学习，以及在网络中表示的降维基础。在我们的设置中，我们利用了随机过程的多项式混沌展开（PCE），并将相应的架构称为SDEONet。在参数化偏微分方程的不确定性量化（UQ）领域中，PCE被广泛使用。然而，在SDE中并非如此，传统的采样方法占主导地位，而功能性方法很少见。截断的PCE存在一个主要挑战，即随着最大多项式阶数和基函数数量的增加，分量的数量呈指数级增长。所提出的SDEONet结构旨在通过学习来减轻指数级复杂度的问题。",
