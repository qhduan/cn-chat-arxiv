As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into social and professional environments, understanding their behavior within the context of social networks and interactions becomes essential. Our study analyzes the behaviors of standard network structures and real-world networks to determine whether the dynamics of multiple LLMs align with human social dynamics. We explore various social network principles, including micro-level concepts such as preferential attachment, triadic closure, and homophily, as well as macro-level concepts like community structure and the small-world phenomenon. Our findings suggest that LLMs demonstrate all these principles when they are provided with network structures and asked about their preferences regarding network formation. Furtherm",

    "translated_abstract": "社交网络影响行为、偏好和关系，在人类社会中对信息和规范的传播起着至关重要的作用。随着大型语言模型（LLMs）越来越多地融入社交和专业环境中，理解它们在社交网络和互动背景下的行为变得至关重要。我们的研究分析了标准网络结构和现实世界网络的行为，以确定多个LLMs的动态是否与人类社交动态一致。我们探讨了各种社交网络原则，包括微观层面的概念，如偏爱附着、三角闭合和同似性，以及宏观层面的概念，如社区结构和小世界现象。我们的研究发现表明，当向LLMs提供网络结构并询问它们对网络形成的偏好时，它们表现出所有这些原则。",
