    "translated_abstract": "网络流量是指通过互联网或连接计算机的任何系统发送和接收的信息量。分析和理解网络流量对于提高网络安全和管理至关重要。然而，由于数据包的特殊特性，如异构标头和缺乏语义的加密负载，网络流量的分析带来了巨大的挑战。为了捕捉流量的潜在语义，一些研究采用了基于Transformer编码器或解码器的预训练技术，从大规模的流量数据中学习表示。然而，这些方法通常只在流量理解（分类）或流量生成任务中表现出色。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了Lens，这是一个基础的网络流量模型，利用T5架构从大规模的无标签数据中学习预训练表示。借助编码器-解码器框架的优势，该模型能够捕捉全局和局部特征，实现精确的流量预测和生成。",
