    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了往往被忽视的现象，首次在\\cite{breiman2001random}中指出，即随机森林似乎比装袋法减少了偏差。受\\cite{mentch2020randomization}一篇有趣的论文的启发，其中作者认为随机森林减少了有效自由度，并且只有在低信噪比（SNR）环境下才能胜过装袋集成，我们探讨了随机森林如何能够揭示被装袋法忽视的数据模式。我们在实证中证明，在存在这种模式的情况下，随机森林不仅可以减小偏差还能减小方差，并且当信噪比高时随机森林的表现愈发好于装袋集成。我们的观察为解释随机森林在各种信噪比情况下的真实世界成功提供了见解，并增进了我们对随机森林与装袋集成在每次分割注入的随机化方面的差异的理解。我们的调查结果还提供了实用见解。",
