    "translated_abstract": "最近大型语言模型在能力上的增强为通信的生成式AI代理团队解决联合任务的应用打开了可能性。这引发了关于未经授权分享信息或其他不必要的代理协调形式的隐私和安全挑战。现代隐写术技术可能使这种动态难以检测。本文通过汲取人工智能和安全领域相关概念，全面系统地形式化了生成式AI代理系统中的秘密勾结问题。我们研究了使用隐写术的动机，并提出了各种缓解措施。我们的研究结果是一个模型评估框架，系统地测试了各种形式的秘密勾结所需的能力。我们在各种当代大型语言模型上提供了广泛的实证结果。虽然当前模型的隐写能力仍然有限，但 GPT-4 显示出能力的飞跃，这表明有必要进行进一步的研究。",
