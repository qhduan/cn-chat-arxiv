Thus, in this work, we conduct a pioneering exploration of GPT stores, aiming to study vulnerabilities and plagiarism within GPT applications. To begin with, we conduct, to our knowledge, the first large-scale monitoring and analysis of two stores, an unofficial GPTStore.AI, and an official OpenAI GPT Store.
