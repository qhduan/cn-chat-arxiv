    "translated_abstract": "基于噪声中等规模量子（NISQ）设备的量子机器学习（QML）需要最佳利用有限的量子资源。常用的基于门的 QML 模型对软件工程师很方便，但其表达能力受限于有限的相干时间内允许的电路深度。相比之下，基于脉冲的模型可以在相同的相干时间内构建“无限”深度的量子神经网络，可能为复杂学习任务释放更强大的表达能力。本文从量子控制理论的视角研究了这个潜力。我们首先指出，脉冲模型的非线性来自编码过程，可以看作是基于门模型中数据重新上传的连续极限。随后，我们证明了在基础物理系统具有集合可控性的条件下，脉冲模型可以逼近任意非线性函数。在这种条件下，数值模拟表明脉冲模型可以超过基于门的模型在特定学习任务上的性能。",
