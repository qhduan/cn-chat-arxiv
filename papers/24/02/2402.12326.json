Traditional methods, such as self-report scales and psychologist interviews, often face challenges with engagement and accessibility.

In this work, we propose PsychoGAT (Psychological Game AgenTs) to achieve a generic gamification of psychological assessment. The main insight is that powerful LLMs can function both as adept psychologists and innovative game designers.

    "translated_abstract": "心理测量对于精神健康、自我理解和个人发展至关重要。传统方法，如自我报告量表和心理学家访谈，常常面临参与度和可获得性方面的挑战。虽然已经探讨了基于游戏和LLM的工具来提高用户兴趣并自动化评估，但它们难以平衡参与度和普适性。在这项工作中，我们提出了PsychoGAT（心理游戏代理），以实现心理评估的通用游戏化。主要洞察是强大的LLM既可以充当熟练的心理学家，也可以是创新的游戏设计师。通过将LLM代理纳入指定角色并精心管理它们的互动，PsychoGAT可以将任何标准量表转化为个性化且具有吸引力的互动小说游戏。为验证所提出的方法，我们进行心理度量评估以评估其有效性，并使用人类",
