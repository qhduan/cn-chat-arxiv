This paper pioneers the exploration of vulnerabilities in LLM-based navigation models in urban outdoor environments, a critical area given the technology's widespread application in autonomous driving, logistics, and emergency services. Specifically, we introduce a novel Navigational Prompt Suffix (NPS) Attack that manipulates LLM-based navigation models by appending gradient-derived suffixes to the original navigational prompt, leading to incorrect actions. We conducted comprehensive experiments on an LLMs-based navigation model that employs various LLMs for reasoning.

    "translated_abstract": "在机器人和自动化领域，基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的导航系统最近展示了令人印象深刻的性能。然而，这些系统的安全性方面受到的关注相对较少。本文在城市户外环境中首次探索了LLM-based导航模型的漏洞，这是一个关键领域，因为该技术广泛应用于自动驾驶、物流和紧急服务。具体地，我们引入了一种新颖的Navigational Prompt Suffix (NPS) Attack，通过将梯度导出的后缀添加到原始导航提示，操纵LLM-based导航模型，从而导致不正确的行为。我们对基于LLMs的导航模型进行了全面的实验，该模型采用各种LLMs进行推理。我们的结果来自Touchdown和Map2Seq街景数据集，在few-shot学习和fine-tuning配置下进行实验，结果证明了NPS Attack的有效性。",
