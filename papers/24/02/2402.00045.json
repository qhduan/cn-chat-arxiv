    "translated_title": "检测大型人工智能模型生成的多媒体内容：一项调查研究",
    "translated_abstract": "大型人工智能模型（LAIMs）的快速发展，尤其是扩散模型和大型语言模型，标志着一种新的时代，人工智能生成的多媒体内容被越来越多地整合到日常生活的各个方面。尽管在许多领域有益，但这些内容也带来了重大风险，包括潜在的滥用、社会破坏和伦理问题。因此，检测由LAIMs生成的多媒体内容变得至关重要，相关研究也大幅增加。尽管如此，目前仍然存在一个明显的问题，即缺乏系统性的调查研究，专门关注检测LAIMs生成的多媒体内容。为了解决这个问题，我们提供了第一份全面涵盖现有研究的调查报告，重点关注检测LAIMs生成的多媒体内容（如文本、图像、视频、音频和多模态内容）。具体而言，我们引入了一种新颖的检测方法分类法，按媒体形式分类，并与纯检测（旨在提高检测性能）和应用场景对齐。",
    "tldr": "本文综述了大型人工智能模型（LAIMs）生成的多媒体内容的检测方法和研究进展，旨在填补现有研究中的空白。我们提供了一种新颖的分类法，并介绍了纯检测和应用场景两个角度来增强检测性能。",
