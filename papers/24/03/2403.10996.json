We introduce AutoDRIVE Ecosystem as an enabling digital twin framework to train, deploy, and transfer cooperative as well as competitive multi-agent reinforcement learning policies from simulation to reality. Particularly, we first investigate an intersection traversal problem of 4 cooperative vehicles (Nigel) that share limited state information in single as well as multi-agent learning settings using a common policy approach. We then investigate an adversarial autonomous racing problem of 2 vehicles (F1TENTH) using an individual policy approach. In either set of experiments, a decentralized learning architecture was adopted, which allowed robust training and testing of the policies ",
