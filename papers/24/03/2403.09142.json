    "translated_abstract": "由于成本效益和可重现性方面的优势，用户模拟已成为信息检索系统用户为中心评估的有前途的解决方案。然而，准确模拟用户搜索行为一直是一项挑战，因为用户在搜索中的行为非常复杂，受到学习、推理和规划等错综复杂认知过程的驱动。最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）已经展示出在模拟人类级智能方面的潜力，并已被用于构建各种任务的自主代理。然而，尚未充分探索使用LLM模拟搜索行为的潜力。在本文中，我们介绍了一种基于LLM的用户搜索行为模拟器，即USimAgent。提出的模拟器可以模拟用户在搜索过程中的查询、点击和停止行为，因此能够生成特定搜索的完整搜索会话。",
