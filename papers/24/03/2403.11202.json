    "translated_abstract": "最近大型语言模型的进展表明，它们在高层提示下自动生成硬件描述语言（HDL）代码的潜力。研究人员利用微调来增强这些大型语言模型（LLMs）在芯片设计领域的能力。然而，缺乏Verilog数据阻碍了LLMs在Verilog生成质量上的进一步提升。此外，缺少Verilog和电子设计自动化（EDA）脚本数据增强框架显着增加了为LLM训练器准备训练数据集所需的时间。本文提出了一种自动设计数据增强框架，它生成与Verilog和EDA脚本对齐的大量高质量自然语言。对于Verilog生成，它将Verilog文件转换为抽象语法树，然后将节点映射到具有预定义模板的自然语言。对于Verilog修复，它",
