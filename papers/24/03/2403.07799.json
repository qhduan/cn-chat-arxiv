We study a canonical model of auctions for multiple indivisible units with unit demand buyers and valuations with a private and a common component and consider all pricing rules that are a mixture (i.e., a convex combination) of pay-as-bid and uniform pricing.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了定价如何影响在多单位拍卖中买家之间的剩余分配。我们的公平目标可能很重要，例如，对于下游市场中的竞争问题，这是对长期关于收入和效率的辩论的一个补充。我们研究了一个经典的多不可分单元拍卖模型，其中有单位需求的买家和具有私有和公共成分的估值，并考虑了所有定价规则，这些规则是按竞标支付和统一定价的混合（即凸组合）。我们提出了赢家的经验方差（WEV），即赢家之间剩余的预期经验方差，作为剩余公平的度量标准。我们表明，在一系列私有-公共价值比例中，技术内部的按竞标付费和统一定价混合最小化了WEV。从公平的角度来看，具有更高私有值成分的拍卖受益于更多的价格歧视，而仅具有足够大小私有值成分的拍卖才能获益。",
