    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.12533v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: How can a robot provide unobtrusive physical support within a group of humans? We present Attentive Support, a novel interaction concept for robots to support a group of humans. It combines scene perception, dialogue acquisition, situation understanding, and behavior generation with the common-sense reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In addition to following user instructions, Attentive Support is capable of deciding when and how to support the humans, and when to remain silent to not disturb the group. With a diverse set of scenarios, we show and evaluate the robot's attentive behavior, which supports and helps the humans when required, while not disturbing if no help is needed.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器人如何在人类群体中提供不引人注目的物理支持？我们提出了Attentive Support，这是一个新颖的机器人与人类群体进行支持的交互概念。它将场景感知、对话获取、情况理解和行为生成与大规模语言模型（LLMs）的常识推理能力相结合。除了遵循用户的指令，Attentive Support能够决定何时以及如何支持人类，并在不干扰群体时保持沉默。通过多样化的场景，我们展示和评估了机器人的专注行为，当需要时支持和帮助人类，而如果不需要帮助，则不会干扰。",
