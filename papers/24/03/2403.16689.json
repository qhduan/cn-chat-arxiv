Despite its similarity to learning factual concepts (e.g., \"red cube\"), preference learning is a fundamentally harder problem due to its subjective nature and the paucity of person-specific training data. We address this problem using a new framework called Synapse, which is a neuro-symbolic approach designed to efficiently learn preferential concepts from limited demonstrations. Synapse represents preferences as neuro-symbolic programs in a domain-specific language (DSL) that operates over images, and leverages a novel combination of visual parsing, large language models, and program synthesis to learn programs representing individual preferences. We evaluate Synapse through extensive experimentation including a user case study focusing on mobility-related",

    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了偏好学习问题，旨在从视觉输入中学习用户特定偏好（例如，“好停车位”，“方便的下车位置”）。尽管与学习事实概念（例如，“红色立方体”）相似，但偏好学习是一个基本更加困难的问题，因为它涉及主观性质和个人特定训练数据的缺乏。我们使用一种名为Synapse的新框架来解决这个问题，这是一种神经符号化方法，旨在有效地从有限演示中学习偏好概念。Synapse将偏好表示为在图像上运作的领域特定语言（DSL）中的神经符号程序，并利用视觉解析、大型语言模型和程序合成的新组合来学习代表个人偏好的程序。我们通过广泛的实验评估了Synapse，包括一个关注与移动相关的用户案例研究。",
