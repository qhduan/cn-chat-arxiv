    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑高维背景下的迁移学习问题，在该问题中，特征维度大于样本大小。为了学习可迁移的信息，该信息可能在特征或源样本之间变化，我们提出一种自适应迁移学习方法，可以检测和聚合特征-wise (F-AdaTrans)或样本-wise (S-AdaTrans)可迁移结构。我们通过采用一种新颖的融合惩罚方法，结合权重，可以根据可迁移结构进行调整。为了选择权重，我们提出了一个在理论上建立，数据驱动的过程，使得 F-AdaTrans 能够选择性地将可迁移的信号与目标融合在一起，同时滤除非可迁移的信号，S-AdaTrans则可以获得每个源样本传递的信息的最佳组合。我们建立了非渐近速率，可以在特殊情况下恢复现有的近最小似乎最优速率。效果证明...",
