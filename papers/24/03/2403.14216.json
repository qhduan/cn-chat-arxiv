Specifically, the transition weight of each regime increases in its relative weighted likelihood. This data-driven approach facilitates capturing complex switching dynamics, enhancing the identification of gradual regime shifts. In an empirical application to the macroeconomic effects of a severe weather shock, we find that in monthly U.S. data from 1961:1 to 2022:3, the impacts of the shock are stronger in the regime prevailing in the early part of the sample and in certain crisis periods than in the regime dominating the latter part of the sample. This suggests overall adaptation of the U.S. economy to increased severe weather over time.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种新的平滑过渡向量自回归模型，其具有高斯条件分布和转换权重，对于第$p$阶模型，这些权重取决于前$p$个观测值的完整分布。具体而言，每个状态的转换权重随其相对加权似然性而增加。这种数据驱动方法有助于捕捉复杂的转换动态，增强逐渐状态转变的识别。在一个关于严重天气冲击对宏观经济影响的实证应用中，我们发现在1961年第1季度至2022年第3季度的美国月度数据中，冲击的影响在样本早期的状态和某些危机时期比在样本后期主导的状态中更为显著。这表明美国经济总体上逐渐适应了随时间增加的严重天气。",
