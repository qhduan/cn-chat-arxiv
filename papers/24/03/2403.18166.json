    "translated_abstract": "预计未来先进空中移动（AAM）的崛起将成为一个数十亿美元的产业。市场机制被认为是AAM运营的一个重要组成部分，其中包括具有私人估值的异构运营商。本文研究了设计一种机制来协调由多个具有与其机群关联的异构估值的运营商操作的电动垂直起降（eVTOL）飞行器在vertiports之间移动的问题，同时强制执行vertiports的到达、离开和停车约束。特别是，我们提出了一种激励兼容且个体理性的vertiport预订机制，该机制最大化了一个社会福利度量标准，从而包括最大化所有运营商的总估值同时最小化vertiports的拥堵。此外，我们提高了设计这一机制的计算可处理性",
