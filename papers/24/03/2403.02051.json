    "translated_abstract": "将重尾噪声注入随机梯度下降(SGD)的迭代中已经引起越来越多的关注。尽管对导致的算法的各种理论性质进行了分析，主要来自学习理论和优化视角，但它们的隐私保护性质尚未建立。为了弥补这一缺口，我们为噪声SGD提供差分隐私(DP)保证，当注入的噪声遵循$\\alpha$-稳定分布时，该分布包括一系列重尾分布(具有无限方差)以及高斯分布。考虑$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP框架，我们表明带有重尾扰动的SGD实现了$(0,\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/n))$-DP的广泛损失函数类，这些函数可以是非凸的，这里$n$是数据点的数量。作为一项显着的副产品，与以往的工作相反，该工作要求有界se",
