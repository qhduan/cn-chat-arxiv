    "translated_abstract": "类似规划领域定义语言（PDDL）之类的经典规划公式允许确定可实现目标状态的动作序列，只要存在任何可能的初始状态。然而，PDDL中定义的推理问题并未捕获行动进行的时间方面，例如领域中的两个智能体如果彼此的后况不干扰前提条件，则可以同时执行一个动作。人类专家可以将目标分解为大部分独立的组成部分，并将每个智能体分配给其中一个子目标，以利用同时进行动作来加快计划步骤的执行，每个部分仅使用单个智能体规划。相比之下，直接推断计划步骤的大型语言模型（LLMs）并不保证执行成功，但利用常识推理来组装动作序列。我们通过近似人类直觉，结合了经典规划和LLMs的优势",
