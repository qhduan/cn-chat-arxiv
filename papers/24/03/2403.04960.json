    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）被扩展为系统，如ChatGPT，已经开始支持第三方应用程序。这些LLM应用程序利用LLMs的事实上基于自然语言的自动执行范式：即，应用程序及其交互是用自然语言定义的，提供对用户数据的访问，并被允许自由地相互交互以及与系统互动。这些LLM应用程序生态系统类似于早期计算平台的设置，在那里应用程序和系统之间缺乏足够的隔离。由于第三方应用程序可能不可信，并且受自然语言界面的不精确性加剧，当前的设计会为用户带来安全和隐私风险。在本文中，我们提出了SecGPT，一种面向LLM系统的架构，旨在缓解由第三方应用程序执行引起的安全性和隐私问题。SecGPT的关键思想是隔离应用程序的执行和更多的预",
