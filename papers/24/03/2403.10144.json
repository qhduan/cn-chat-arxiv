    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络在自然语言处理（NLP）领域取得了显著成功，确保它们的安全性和可靠性至关重要：在安全关键的情境中，这些模型必须对变化或攻击具有鲁棒性，并能对其输出给出保证。与计算机视觉不同，NLP缺乏一个统一的验证方法论，尽管近年来文献中取得了一些进展，但对于NLP验证的实用问题常常涉及不深。在本文中，我们尝试提炼和评估一个NLP验证流程的一般组成部分，该流程来源于迄今为止该领域的进展。我们的贡献有两方面：首先，我们给出了将句子嵌入连续空间得到的可验证子空间的一般描述。我们确定了可验证子空间的语义泛化技术挑战，并提出了一种有效处理的方法。",
