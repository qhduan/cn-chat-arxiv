GPT-4 substantially outperforms other large language models, including Gemini Ultra and Claude 2. The coding performance of GPT-4 varies considerably with different prompt strategies. In most LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks coding contests evaluated in this study, GPT-4 employing the optimal prompt strategy outperforms 85 percent of human participants. Additionally, GPT-4 demonstrates strong capabilities in translating code between different programming languages and in learning from past errors. The computational efficiency of the code generated by GPT-4 is comparable to that of human programmers. These results suggest that GPT-4 has the potential to serve as a reliable assistant in programming code generation and software development.",
