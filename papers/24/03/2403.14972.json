    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.14972v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a pilot study aimed at introducing multi-agent debate into multimodal reasoning. The study addresses two key challenges: the trivialization of opinions resulting from excessive summarization and the diversion of focus caused by distractor concepts introduced from images. These challenges stem from the inductive (bottom-up) nature of existing debating schemes. To address the issue, we propose a deductive (top-down) debating approach called Blueprint Debate on Graphs (BDoG). In BDoG, debates are confined to a blueprint graph to prevent opinion trivialization through world-level summarization. Moreover, by storing evidence in branches within the graph, BDoG mitigates distractions caused by frequent but irrelevant concepts. Extensive experiments validate BDoG, achieving state-of-the-art results in Science QA and MMBench with significant improvements over previous methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一项旨在将多智能体辩论引入多模态推理的试点研究。该研究解决了两个关键挑战：由于过度总结而导致意见陈腐化，以及由于图像引入转移性概念而导致注意力分散的问题。这些挑战源自现有辩论方案的归纳（自下而上）性质。为解决这一问题，我们提出了一种演绎（自上而下）的辩论方法，称为图谱辩论（BDoG）。在BDoG中，辩论仅限于蓝图图中，以防止通过世界级摘要而导致意见陈腐化。此外，通过在图中的分支中存储证据，BDoG缓解了频繁但无关的概念带来的分散注意力现象。大量实验验证了BDoG，在科学问答和MMBench中取得了最新成果，并相较于先前的方法具有显著改进。",
