GFACS integrates generative flow networks (GFlowNets) with the ant colony optimization (ACO) methodology. GFlowNets, a generative model that learns a constructive policy in combinatorial spaces, enhance ACO by providing an informed prior distribution of decision variables conditioned on input graph instances. Furthermore, we introduce a novel combination of training tricks, including search-guided local exploration, energy normalization, and energy shaping to improve GFACS.
