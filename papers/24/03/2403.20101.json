    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了RealKIE，这是一个旨在推动关键信息提取方法发展的五个具有挑战性的数据集基准，重点是企业应用。这些数据集包括美国SEC S1文件、美国保密协议、英国慈善报告、FCC发票和资源合同等各种类型的文档。每个数据集都具有独特的挑战：文本序列化不佳、长文档中稀疏的注释和复杂的表格布局。这些数据集为关键信息提取任务（如投资分析和法律数据处理）提供了一个现实的测试基地。除了介绍这些数据集外，我们还提供了对注释过程、文档处理技术和基线建模方法的深入描述。这一贡献促进了能够处理实际挑战的NLP模型的发展，并支持进一步研究可应用于工业的信息提取技术。",
