    "translated_abstract": "Kakade的自然策略梯度方法近年来得到广泛研究，表明在有或无正则化的情况下具有线性收敛性。我们研究了另一种基于状态-动作分布的Fisher信息矩阵的自然梯度方法，但在理论方面接受度较低。在这里，状态-动作分布在状态-动作多面体内遵循Fisher-Rao梯度流，相对于线性势。因此，我们更全面地研究线性规划的Fisher-Rao梯度流，并显示了线性收敛性，其速率取决于线性规划的几何特性。换句话说，这提供了线性规划的熵正则化引起的误差估计，这改进了现有结果。我们拓展了这些结果，并展示了对扰动的Fisher-Rao梯度流和自然梯度流的次线性收敛性，直到逼近误差。",
