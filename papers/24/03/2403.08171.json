    "translated_abstract": "虽然众所周知在线梯度下降和其他无悔学习程序可以有效地收敛到协调均衡，在每个Agent的效用对于其自身策略呈凹形的情况下，但当效用是非凹的时，这种情况在机器学习应用中很常见，其中Agent的策略由深度神经网络参数化，或者Agent的效用由神经网络计算，或两者兼而有之。实际上，非凹游戏存在一系列博弈论和优化挑战：(i) Nash均衡可能不存在；(ii) 局部Nash均衡存在但是不可处理；(iii) 混合Nash、协调和粗糙协调均衡在一般情况下具有无限支持，并且是不可处理的。为了避开这些挑战，我们提出了一个新的解决概念，称为$(\\varepsilon, \\Phi(\\delta))$-局部均衡，该概念在非凹游戏中概括了局部Nash均衡。",
