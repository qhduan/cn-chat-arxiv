Yet the applicability of these mechanisms remains limited in repeated auction settings, as it is challenging for users to learn how to bid an artificial currency that has no value outside the auctions. Indeed, users must jointly learn the value of the currency in addition to how to spend it optimally. In this work, we study the problem of learning to bid in two prominent classes of artificial currency auctions: those in which currency, which users spend to obtain public resources, is only issued at the beginning of a finite period; and those where, in addition to the initial currency endowment, currency payments are redistributed to users at each time step.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，在那些认为货币工具不公平或不恰当的情境中出现了一大批基于人工货币的机制，例如，在将食物捐赠分配给食物银行、将课程席位分配给学生，甚至最近甚至用于交通拥堵管理。然而，这些机制在重复拍卖设置中的适用性仍然有限，因为用户很难学会如何出价一种在拍卖之外没有价值的人工货币。事实上，用户必须共同学习货币的价值，以及如何最优化地花费它。在这项工作中，我们研究了在两个著名类别的人工货币拍卖中学习出价的问题：一种是在有限时间段开始时仅颁发货币的拍卖，用户通过花费货币获得公共资源；另一种是除了初始货币资产外，在每个时间步将货币支付重新分配给用户。",
