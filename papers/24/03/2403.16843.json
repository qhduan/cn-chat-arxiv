    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)越来越多地被用于(交互式)决策制定，通过开发基于LLM的自主代理。尽管它们取得了不断的成功，但LLM代理在决策制定中的表现尚未通过定量指标进行充分调查，特别是在它们相互作用时的多代理设置中，这是实际应用中的典型场景。为了更好地理解LLM代理在这些交互环境中的限制，我们建议研究它们在在线学习和博弈论的基准决策设置中的相互作用，并通过\\emph{后悔}性能指标进行评估。我们首先在经典(非平稳)在线学习问题中经验性地研究LLMs的无后悔行为，以及当LLM代理通过进行重复游戏进行交互时均衡的出现。然后我们对无后悔行为提供一些理论洞见。",
