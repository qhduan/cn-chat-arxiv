    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.06095v1 公告类型：交叉摘要：代码大型语言模型（CodeLLMs）在代码补全任务中展示出令人印象深刻的熟练程度。然而，它们经常无法完全理解项目仓库的广泛上下文，比如相关文件和类层次结构的复杂性，这可能导致补全不够精确。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了RepoHyper，一个旨在解决与仓库级代码补全相关的复杂挑战的多方面框架。RepoHyper的核心是Repo级语义图（RSG），一种封装代码仓库广泛上下文的新颖语义图结构。此外，RepoHyper利用扩展和细化检索方法，包括应用于RSG的图扩展和链接预测算法，从而实现对相关代码片段的有效检索和优先排序。我们的评估表明，RepoHyper在重新",
