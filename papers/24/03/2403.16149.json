While CIoT has improved the convenience of people's daily lives, it has also brought new security and privacy concerns. In this survey, we try to figure out what researchers can learn about the security and privacy of CIoT by traffic analysis, a popular method in the security community. From the security and privacy perspective, this survey seeks out the new characteristics in CIoT traffic analysis, the state-of-the-art progress in CIoT traffic analysis, and the challenges yet to be solved. We collected 310 papers from January 2018 to December 2023 related to CIoT traffic analysis from the security and privacy perspective and summarized the process of CIoT traffic analysis in which the new characteristics of CIoT are identified. Then, we detail existing works based on five application goals: device fingerprinting, user activity inference, malicious",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去几年里，消费者物联网（CIoT）已经进入了公众生活。尽管CIoT提高了人们日常生活的便利性，但也带来了新的安全和隐私问题。我们尝试通过流量分析这一安全领域中的流行方法，找出研究人员可以从流量分析中了解CIoT安全和隐私方面的内容。本调查从安全和隐私角度探讨了CIoT流量分析中的新特征、CIoT流量分析的最新进展以及尚未解决的挑战。我们从2018年1月至2023年12月收集了310篇与CIoT流量分析有关的安全和隐私角度的论文，总结了识别了CIoT新特征的CIoT流量分析过程。然后，我们根据五个应用目标详细介绍了现有的研究工作：设备指纹识别、用户活动推断、恶意行为检测、隐私泄露以及通信模式识别。",
