    "translated_abstract": "生成式人工智能（GAI）提供了前所未有的可能性，但其商业化引发了关于透明度、可重现性、偏见和安全性的担忧。许多\"开源\"的GAI模型缺乏完整理解和再现所必需的组件，一些采用限制性许可证，这种行为被称为\"开源洗白\"。我们提出了模型开放框架（MOF），这是一个根据完整性和开放性对机器学习模型进行排名分类的系统，遵循开放科学、开源、开放数据和开放获取的原则。MOF要求模型开发生命周期的特定组件被包含并根据适当的开放许可证发布。该框架旨在防止宣称自己是开放的模型被误解，指导研究人员和开发者以宽松的许可证发布所有模型组件，并帮助公司、学术界和爱好者识别可以安全采用的模型。",
