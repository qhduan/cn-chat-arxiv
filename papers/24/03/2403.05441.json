As a benchmark model, we use all available intraday transactions at the time of forecast creation to compute a current value for the IDFull.

    "translated_abstract": "我们首次提出了对德国连续日内市场交易的电力价格进行贝叶斯预测的研究，充分考虑参数不确定性。我们的目标变量是IDFull价格指数，预测以后验预测分布的形式给出。我们使用了2022年极度波动的电力价格进行验证，在之前几乎没有成为预测研究对象。作为基准模型，我们使用了预测创建时的所有可用日内交易来计算IDFull的当前值。根据弱式有效假设，从最后价格信息建立的基准无法显著改善。然而，我们观察到在点度量和概率评分方面存在着统计显著的改进。最后，我们挑战了在电力价格预测中使用LASSO进行特征选择的宣布的黄金标准。",
