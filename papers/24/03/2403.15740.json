In this work, we suggest that users repeatedly insert personal passphrases into their documents, enabling LLMs to memorize them. These concealed passphrases in user documents, referred to as \\textit{ghost sentences}, once they are identified in the generated content of LLMs, users can be sure that their data is used for training. To explore the effectiveness and usage of this copyrighting tool, we define the \\textit{user training data identification} task with ghost sentences.

    "translated_abstract": "Web用户数据在预训练大型语言模型（LLMs）及其微调变种的生态系统中起着核心作用。本文提出了一种方法，建议用户在其文档中反复插入个人密码，使LLMs能够记忆这些密码。这些用户文档中隐藏的密码，被称为“幽灵句子”，一旦它们出现在LLMs生成的内容中，用户就可以确信他们的数据被用于训练。为了探索这种版权工具的有效性和用法，我们利用幽灵句子定义了“用户训练数据识别”任务。我们创建了来自不同来源、不同规模的多个数据集，并使用不同规模的LLMs进行测试。为了评估，我们引入了一个最后$k$个单词验证的方式。",
