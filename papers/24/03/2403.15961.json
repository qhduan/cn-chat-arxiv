    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们提出了基于偏序的整数线性规划（ILP）模型的图着色问题（GCP）和带宽着色问题（BCP）的新SAT编码。 GCP要求给定图的顶点分配最少数量的颜色，以便每两个相邻的顶点得到不同的颜色。 BCP是一个泛化问题，其中每条边都有一个权重，要求分配的颜色之间有最小的“距离”，目标是最小化使用的“最大”颜色。 对于被广泛研究的GCP，我们在DIMACS基准集上实验比较了我们新的SAT编码与现有最先进方法。 我们的评估证实，这种SAT编码对于稀疏图是有效的，并且甚至在一些DIMACS示例上胜过了现有最先进方法。 对于BCP，我们的理论分析表明，基于偏序的SAT和ILP公式的大小在渐近意义下小于经典的解法。",
