    "translated_abstract": "食物对健康的深远影响使得先进的营养导向食品推荐服务成为必要。传统方法往往缺乏个性化、可解释性和互动性等关键元素。虽然大型语言模型（LLMs）带来了解释性和可解释性，但它们单独的使用未能实现真正的个性化。本文介绍了ChatDiet，一种新颖的LLM驱动框架，专门设计用于个性化营养导向食品推荐聊天机器人。ChatDiet集成了个人和人群模型，辅以一个协调器，无缝检索和处理相关信息。其结果是动态提供个性化和可解释的食品推荐，根据个人用户喜好定制。我们对ChatDiet进行了评估，包括一个引人入胜的案例研究，在案例研究中建立了一个因果个人模型来估计个人营养效果。",
