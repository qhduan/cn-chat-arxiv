    "translated_abstract": "最近，隐式神经表示（INR）在图像表示和压缩方面取得了巨大成功，提供了高视觉质量和快速渲染速度，每秒10-1000帧，假设有足够的GPU资源可用。然而，这种要求常常阻碍了它们在内存有限的低端设备上的使用。为此，我们提出了一种通过2D高斯喷涂进行图像表示和压缩的开创性范式，名为GaussianImage。我们首先引入2D高斯来表示图像，其中每个高斯具有8个参数，包括位置、协方差和颜色。随后，我们揭示了一种基于累积求和的新颖渲染算法。值得注意的是，我们的方法使用GPU内存至少降低3倍，拟合时间快5倍，不仅在表示性能上与INR（例如WIRE，I-NGP）不相上下，而且无论参数大小如何都能提供1500-2000帧每秒的更快渲染速度。",
