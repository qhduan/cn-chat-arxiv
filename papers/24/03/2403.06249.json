    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLM）的发展显著推动了金融分析，但它们的应用主要局限在单一语言领域，未充分开发中英文双语能力的潜力。为弥合这一鸿沟，我们引入 ICE-PIXIU，无缝融合 ICE-INTENT 模型和 ICE-FLARE 双语金融分析基准。ICE-PIXIU 独特地整合了一系列中文任务，以及翻译和原始英文数据集，丰富了双语金融建模的广度和深度。它提供了对多种模型变体的无限访问权限，一个包含多种跨语言和多模态指导数据的大量编译，以及一个具有专家注释的评估基准，包括 10 个 NLP 任务，20 个双语专用任务，共计1,185k 数据集。我们的彻底评估强调了将这些双语数据集纳入的优势，尤其在t",
