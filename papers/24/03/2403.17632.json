    "translated_abstract": "车辆拥堵和环境恶化带来的挑战日益加剧，凸显了在城市空间推行E-Mobility解决方案的重要性。特别是，E-滑板车和E-自行车等微型E-Mobility工具在这一转变中发挥着关键作用，为城市通勤者提供可持续的替代方案。然而，这些工具的能耗模式是影响其在现实场景中有效性的关键因素，对于出行规划以及增强用户在使用这些工具时的信心至关重要。为此，最近的研究利用针对特定移动工具和条件定制的物理模型，但这些模型在现实场景中的泛化能力和有效性存在困难，这是因为缺乏用于彻底模型评估和验证的开放数据集。为填补这一空白，我们的工作提出了一个在爱尔兰都柏林收集的开放数据集，专门用于能耗建模。",
