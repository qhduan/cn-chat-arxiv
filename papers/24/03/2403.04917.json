    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种寻找移动目标旅行推销员问题（MT-TSP）的最佳解决方案的新的公式，该问题旨在找到一个最短路径，使一个从仓库出发的代理访问一组移动目标，并在它们分配的时间窗口内恰好访问一次，然后返回到仓库。该公式依赖于一个关键思想，即当目标沿着线移动时，它们的轨迹在空间-时间坐标系内变为凸集。然后，问题就缩减为在一个凸集图中寻找最短路径，受到一些速度约束的限制。我们将我们的公式与当前最先进的Mixed Integer Conic Program (MICP)求解器进行了比较，结果显示，我们的公式在目标数量最多为20个的情况下性能优于MICP，在运行时间上缩短了两个数量级，并且最优性差距缩小了高达60％。我们还展示了该解法的成本...",
