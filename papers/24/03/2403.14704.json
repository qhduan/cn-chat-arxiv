In this paper, we first argue that Coalition Logic models, concurrent game models, have three too-strong assumptions. The first one is the independence of agents; that is, the merge of two available joint actions of two disjoint coalitions is always available for the union of the two coalitions. The second one is seriality; that is, coalitions always have available joint actions. The third one is determinism, that is, the grand coalition's joint actions always have a unique outcome. Second, we present a coalition logic based on general concurrent game models, which do not have the three assumptions. We show the completeness of this logic and compare it with Coalition Logic in detail. This logic seems minimal in the context of strategic reasoning.",

    "translated_title": "一个最小联盟逻辑",
    "translated_abstract": "联盟逻辑是战略推理研究中的一个中心逻辑。本文首先指出联盟逻辑模型，即并发博弈模型，存在三个过于强的假设。其一是代理的独立性；即，两个不同联盟的两个可用联合动作的合并总是可以合并成两个联盟的联盟。其二是序列性；即，联盟总是有可用的联合动作。其三是确定性，即，大联盟的合作动作总是有唯一结果。其次，我们提出了一个基于一般并发博弈模型的联盟逻辑，该模型不具备这三个假设。我们展示了这一逻辑的完备性，并与联盟逻辑进行了详细比较。在战略推理的背景下，这一逻辑似乎是最小的。",
