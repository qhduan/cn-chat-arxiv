    "translated_abstract": "通道反馈中可靠且高效的编码方案设计一直是通信理论中一项长期挑战。虽然深度学习技术取得了显著进展，神经编码往往面临计算成本高、缺乏可解释性以及在资源受限环境中的实用性有限等问题。本文旨在设计解释性强且更适用于通信系统的低复杂度编码方案。我们先进了解析编码和神经编码。首先，我们展示了POWERBLAST，一种受Schalkwijk-Kailath（SK）和Gallager-Nakiboglu（GN）方案启发的解析编码方案，在高信噪比（SNR）区域实现了明显的可靠性改进，胜过神经编码。接下来，为了增强低SNR区域的可靠性，我们提出了LIGHTCODE，一种轻量级神经编码，实现了最先进的可靠性。",
