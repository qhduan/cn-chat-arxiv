As computers have become a part of students' academic lives, they will grow further in the future. We propose anthropometric-based furniture dimensions suitable for university students to improve computer laboratory ergonomics. We collected data from 380 participants and analyzed 11 anthropometric measurements, correlating them to 11 furniture dimensions. Two types of furniture were studied: a non-adjustable chair with a non-adjustable table and an adjustable chair with a non-adjustable table. The mismatch calculation showed a significant difference between furniture dimensions and anthropometric measurements. The one-way ANOVA test with a significance level of 5% also showed a significant difference between proposed and existing furniture dimensions. The proposed dimensions were found to be more compatible and reduced mismatch percentage",

    "translated_abstract": "许多研究表明，人体工程学设计的家具能提高工作效率和身心健康。随着计算机成为学生学术生活的一部分，它们在未来将进一步普及。我们提出基于人体测量的家具尺寸，适合大学生以改善计算机实验室的人体工程学。我们收集了380名参与者的数据，分析了11项人体测量，并将它们与11项家具尺寸进行了相关性分析。研究了两种类型的家具：非可调椅子与非可调桌子，以及可调椅子与非可调桌子。不匹配计算显示家具尺寸与人体测量之间存在显著差异。显著水平为5%的单因素方差分析测试还显示了所提出的和现有的家具尺寸之间存在显著差异。发现所提出的尺寸更加兼容，减少了不匹配百分比。",
