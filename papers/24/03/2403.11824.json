    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一个在一般离散时间无摩擦市场中的健壮效用最大化问题。投资者被假定具有一个随机、非凹且非递减的效用函数，该函数可能在整个实数线上是有限的，也可能不是有限的。她还面临对市场信念的模型不确定性，这是通过一组先验来建模的。我们证明了当效用函数也是上半连续的时，存在一个最优投资策略。为此，我们引入了新的射影可测函数的概念。我们展示了这些函数的基本属性，如在求和、差异、乘积、上确界、下确界和复合下的稳定性，但也假设射影决定性的集合论公理下积分下的稳定性和存在$\\epsilon$-最优选择器。我们考虑射影可测的随机效用函数和价格过程，并假设它们的图形为...",
