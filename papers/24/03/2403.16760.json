Today, the principal defense against being misled by synthetic media relies on the ability of the human observer to visually and auditorily discern between real and fake. However, it remains unclear just how vulnerable people actually are to deceptive synthetic media in the course of their day to day lives. We conducted a perceptual study with 1276 participants to assess how accurate people were at distinguishing synthetic images, audio only, video only, and audiovisual stimuli from authentic. To reflect the circumstances under which people would likely encounter synthetic media in the wild, testing conditions and stimuli emulated a typical online platform, while all synthetic media used in the survey was sourced from ",

    "translated_abstract": "随着合成媒体变得越来越逼真，使用它的障碍不断降低，这项技术越来越被恶意利用，从金融欺诈到非自愿色情。今天，对抗被合成媒体误导的主要防御依赖于人类观察者在视觉和听觉上区分真假的能力。然而，人们在日常生活中实际上对欺骗性合成媒体有多脆弱仍不清楚。我们进行了一个包含1276名参与者的感知研究，评估人们在区分合成图像、仅音频、仅视频和音视频刺激与真实的准确性如何。为了反映人们在野外可能遇到合成媒体的情况，测试条件和刺激模拟了典型的在线平台，而调查中使用的所有合成媒体均来自",
