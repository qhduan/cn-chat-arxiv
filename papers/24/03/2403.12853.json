Towards this vision, we propose RASP, a modular and reconfigurable sensing and actuation platform that allows drones to autonomously swap onboard sensors and actuators in only 25 seconds, allowing a single drone to quickly adapt to a diverse range of tasks. RASP consists of a mechanical layer to physically swap sensor modules, an electrical layer to maintain power and communication lines to the sensor/actuator, and a software layer to maintain a common interface between the drone and any sensor module in our platform.

    "translated_abstract": "实现消费级无人机与我们家中的吸尘机器人或日常生活中的个人智能手机一样有用，需要无人机能感知、驱动和响应可能出现的一般情况。为了实现这一愿景，我们提出了RASP，一个模块化和可重构的传感和作动平台，允许无人机在仅25秒内自主更换机载传感器和执行器，使单个无人机能够快速适应各种任务。RASP包括一个机械层，用于物理更换传感器模块，一个电气层，用于维护传感器/执行器的电源和通信线路，以及一个软件层，用于在无人机和我们平台上的任何传感器模块之间维护一个公共接口。利用最近在大型语言和视觉语言模型方面的进展，我们进一步介绍了一种利用RASP的个人助理系统的架构、实现和现实世界部署。",
