For the centralized problem including a single legitimate agent, we present a new framework based on NeuroEvolution (NE), whereas, for the decentralized problem, we develop a novel NE-based method for solving collaborative multi-agent tasks, which interestingly maintains all computational benefits of single-agent NE. The superiority of the proposed EAHT approaches over conventional active hypothesis testing policies, as well as learning-based methods, is validated through numerical investigations in an example use case of anomaly detection over wireless sensor networks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文关注存在窥视者情况下的主动假设测试中的一个集中式问题和一个分散式问题。针对包括单个合法智能体的集中式问题，我们提出了基于神经进化（NE）的新框架；而针对分散式问题，我们开发了一种新颖的基于NE的方法，用于解决协作多智能体任务，这种方法有趣地保持了单一智能体NE的所有计算优势。通过对无线传感器网络上异常检测示例用例中的数值实验，验证了所提出的EAHT方法优于传统的主动假设测试策略以及基于学习的方法。",
