This paper pioneers the investigation of editing conceptual knowledge for LLMs, by constructing a novel benchmark dataset ConceptEdit and establishing a suite of new metrics for evaluation. The experimental results reveal that, although existing editing methods can efficiently modify concept-level definition to some extent, they also have the potential to distort the related instantial knowledge in LLMs, leading to poor performance.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，对于大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识编辑引起了越来越多的关注。当前的方法和评估仅探讨了实例级别的编辑，然而LLMs是否具有修改概念的能力仍不清楚。本文首次研究了为LLMs编辑概念知识，通过构建一个新颖的基准数据集ConceptEdit并建立了一套新的评估指标。实验结果表明，尽管现有的编辑方法可以有效地在一定程度上修改概念级别的定义，但它们也有潜力扭曲LLMs中相关的实例知识，导致性能不佳。我们期望这可以激发对更好理解LLMs的进一步进展。我们的项目主页位于https://zjunlp.github.io/project/ConceptEdit。",
