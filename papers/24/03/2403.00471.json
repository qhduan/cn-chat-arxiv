If it is useful for the private sector to insure idiosyncratic risk, government debt expansions can increase the natural rate of interest and create inflation.

Further analysis using a full-blown 2-asset HANK model reveals the quantitative magnitude of the mechanism to crucially depend on the structure of the asset market: under standard assumptions, the effect of public debt on the natural rate is either overly strong or overly weak. Employing a parsimonious way to overcome this issue, my framework suggests relevant effects of public debt on inflation under active monetary policy: In particular, persistently elevated public debt may make it harder to go the last \"mile of disinflation\" unless central banks explicitly take its effect ",

    "translated_abstract": "公共债务对价格稳定有何重要性？如果私营部门为了保险特质风险而有用，政府债务扩张可能会提高自然利率并导致通货膨胀。正如我在一个易处理的模型中展示的那样，这在存在积极的泰勒规则的情况下成立，并且并不需要未来财政巩固的缺席。进一步使用一个完整的2资产HANK模型进行分析，揭示了这一机制的定量影响在很大程度上取决于资产市场的结构：在标准假设下，公共债务对自然利率的影响要么过于强大，要么过于弱。采用简明的方法来克服这个问题，我的框架表明公共债务对活跃的货币政策下通货膨胀产生相关影响：特别是，持续升高的公共债务可能使实现通货紧缩的最后一“英里”变得更加困难，除非央行明确考虑其影响。",
