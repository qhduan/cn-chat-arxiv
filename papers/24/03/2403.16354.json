    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了ChatDBG，这是第一个基于人工智能的调试助手。ChatDBG集成了大型语言模型(LLMs)，显著增强了传统调试器的功能和用户友好性。ChatDBG允许程序员与调试器进行协作对话，使他们能够提出关于程序状态的复杂问题，对崩溃或断言失败进行根本原因分析，并探索诸如“为什么x为空？”之类的开放性查询。为了处理这些查询，ChatDBG授予LLM自主权，通过发出命令来浏览堆栈和检查程序状态进行调试；然后报告其发现并将控制权交还给程序员。我们的ChatDBG原型与标准调试器集成，包括LLDB、GDB和WinDBG用于本地代码以及用于Python的Pdb。我们在各种代码集合上进行了评估，包括具有已知错误的C/C++代码和一套Python代码。",
