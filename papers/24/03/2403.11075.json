In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative communication framework, Goal-Oriented Mental Alignment (GOMA). GOMA formulates verbal communication as a planning problem that minimizes the misalignment between the parts of agents' mental states that are relevant to the goals. This approach enables an embodied assistant to reason about when and how to proactively initialize communication with humans verbally using natural language to help achieve better cooperation.

    "translated_abstract": "口头交流在人类合作中起着至关重要的作用，特别是当合作伙伴只对任务、环境和彼此的心理状态具有不完整的信息时。本文提出了一种新颖的合作沟通框架，即面向目标的心智对齐（GOMA）。GOMA将口头交流形式化为一个规划问题，通过最小化与目标相关的智能体心智状态部分之间的不一致性来促进合作。这种方法使得一个具有身体的助手能够推理何时以及如何以自然语言主动开始与人类的口头沟通，从而帮助实现更好的合作。我们在两个具有挑战性的环境，Overcooked（一款多人游戏）和VirtualHome（一个家庭模拟器）中，对我们的方法进行了评估。实验结果表明，大型语言模型在生成基于语境的有意义沟通方面存在困难。",
