This paper introduces RepairAgent, the first work to address the program repair challenge through an autonomous agent based on a large language model (LLM).

    "translated_abstract": "自动程序修复已经成为一种强大的技术，可以减轻软件漏洞对系统可靠性和用户体验的影响。本文介绍了RepairAgent，这是第一个通过基于大型语言模型(LLM)的自主代理解决程序修复挑战的工作。与现有的基于深度学习的方法不同，这些方法会用固定的提示或在固定的反馈循环中提示模型，我们的工作将LLM视为一种能够自主规划和执行修复操作的代理程序，通过调用适当的工具修复漏洞。RepairAgent自由地交织着收集有关漏洞的信息、收集修复材料以及验证修复过程，并根据收集到的信息和先前的修复尝试反馈决定调用哪些工具。实现RepairAgent的关键贡献包括一组有助于程序修复的工具，以及一个动态更新的提示格式，使LLM能够进行交互。",
