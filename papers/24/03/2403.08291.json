To solve these challenges, our key idea is to propose a Python library with declarative, unified APIs for standardizing column types, simplifying the code generation of LLM with concise API calls.

    "translated_abstract": "数据标准化是数据科学生命周期中至关重要的一部分。虽然诸如Pandas之类的工具提供了强大的功能，但它们的复杂性以及需要定制代码以适应不同列类型的手动操作带来了重大挑战。尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT已经展现出通过自然语言理解和代码生成自动化此过程的潜力，但仍需要专业程度的编程知识和持续互动以进行及时的完善。为了解决这些挑战，我们的关键想法是提出一个具有声明性、统一API的Python库，用于标准化列类型，通过简洁的API调用简化LLM的代码生成流程。我们首先提出了Dataprep.Clean，作为Dataprep库的一个组件，通过一行代码实现特定列类型的标准化，极大降低了复杂性。然后我们介绍了CleanAgen",
