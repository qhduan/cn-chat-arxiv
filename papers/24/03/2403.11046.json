    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT的出现引发了一年多的监管狂潮。然而，少数现有研究严格质疑了这样一个假设：如果不经规范，AI聊天机器人的输出会对人类事务造成实质且严重的伤害。大多数研究人员忽视了信息市场本身可以有效减轻这些风险的关键可能性，并因此倾向于使用监管工具直接解决问题。本文通过关注各种渠道之间的信息竞争，发展了一个重新评估AI相关内容风险和相应监管提议的标准。长达数十年的信息和通信技术监管史表明，监管者在面对新技术带来的不确定性时往往过于谨慎，并在提出过度的监管措施时犯错误。事实上，丰富的经验数据支持了信息市场机制在信息监管方面的作用。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes the possibility of using inter-informational competition in the information market to effectively mitigate risks associated with AI chatbot outputs, and highlights the tendency of regulators to be overly cautious and in need of reevaluating regulatory strategies when facing uncertainties brought by new technologies."
