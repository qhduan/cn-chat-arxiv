This study explores whether Twitter mentions of retracted articles can signal potential problems with the articles prior to retraction, thereby playing a role in predicting future retraction of problematic articles. A dataset comprising 3,505 retracted articles and their associated Twitter mentions is analyzed, alongside 3,505 non-retracted articles with similar characteristics obtained using the Coarsened Exact Matching method. The effectiveness of Twitter mentions in predicting article retraction is evaluated by four prediction methods, including manual labelling, keyword identification, machine learning models, and ChatGPT. Manual labelling results indicate that there are indeed retracted articles with their Twitter mentions containing recognizable evidence signaling problems before retraction, although they represent only a limited share of all retracted articles with ",

    "translated_abstract": "检测有问题的研究文章具有重要意义，本研究探讨了根据被撤回文章在Twitter上的提及是否能够在文章被撤回前发出信号，从而在预测未来被撤回的有问题文章方面发挥作用。分析了包括3,505篇已撤回文章及其相关Twitter提及在内的数据集，以及使用粗糙精确匹配方法获取的具有类似特征的3,505篇未撤回文章。通过四种预测方法评估了Twitter提及在预测文章撤回方面的有效性，包括手动标注、关键词识别、机器学习模型和ChatGPT。手动标注的结果表明，的确有被撤回的文章，其Twitter提及包含在撤回前发出信号的可识别证据，尽管它们只占所有被撤回文章的一小部分。",
