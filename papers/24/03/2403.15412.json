We observe that none of the studies define \"culture,\" which is a complex, multifaceted concept; instead, they probe the models on some specially designed datasets which represent certain aspects of \"culture.\" We call these aspects the proxies of cultures, and organize them across three dimensions of demographic, semantic and linguistic-cultural interaction proxies. We also categorize the probing methods employed. Our analysis indicates that only certain aspects of \"culture,\" such as values and objectives, have been studied, leaving several other interesting and important facets, especially the multitude of semantic domains (Thompson et al., 2020) and aboutness (Hershcovich et al., 2022), unexplored. Two other crucial gaps are the lack of robustness and situatedness of the current methods. Based on these observations",

    "translated_abstract": "我们呈现了对39篇最新论文的调查，旨在研究大型语言模型中的文化表达和包容性。我们观察到，没有一篇研究定义“文化”，这是一个复杂、多层面的概念；相反，它们在一些特别设计的数据集上对模型进行探究，这些数据集代表了某些“文化”的方面。我们将这些方面称为文化的代理，并将它们组织在人口统计、语义和语言文化交互代理的三个维度上。我们还对采用的探查方法进行了分类。我们的分析表明，只有“文化”的某些方面，如价值观和目标，被研究了，留下了几个其他有趣且重要的方面，特别是大量语义领域和关于性（Hershcovich等人，2022）的未被探究。另外两个关键的空白是目前方法的鲁棒性和情境性的缺乏。基于这些观察结果，",
