    "translated_abstract": "在拥挤环境中对非全向机器人进行导航需要极其精确的感知和运动以避免碰撞。本文提出NeuPAN：一种实时、高度准确、无地图、适用于各种机器人，且对环境不变的机器人导航解决方案。NeuPAN采用紧耦合的感知-运动框架，与现有方法相比有两个关键创新：1）它直接将原始点映射到学习到的多帧距离空间，避免了从感知到控制的误差传播；2）从端到端基于模型学习的角度进行解释，实现了可证明的收敛。NeuPAN的关键在于利用插拔式（PnP）交替最小化传感器（PAN）网络解高维端到端数学模型，其中包含各种点级约束，使NeuPAN能够直接生成实时、端到端、物理可解释的运动。",
