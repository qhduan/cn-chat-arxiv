    "translated_abstract": "我们审查了部分共享的在线联邦学习（PSO-Fed）算法对抵抗模型投毒攻击的韧性。 PSO-Fed通过使客户端在每个更新轮次仅与服务器交换部分模型估计来减少通信负载。模型估计的部分共享还增强了算法对模型投毒攻击的强度。为了更好地理解这一现象，我们分析了PSO-Fed算法在存在拜占庭客户端的情况下的性能，这些客户端可能会在与服务器共享之前通过添加噪声轻微篡改其本地模型。通过我们的分析，我们证明了PSO-Fed在均值和均方意义上都能保持收敛，即使在模型投毒攻击的压力下也是如此。我们进一步推导了PSO-Fed的理论均方误差（MSE），将其与步长、攻击概率、数字等各种参数联系起来。",
    "tldr": "PSO-Fed算法的部分共享机制不仅可以降低通信负载，还能增强算法对模型投毒攻击的抵抗力，并且在面对拜占庭客户端的情况下依然能保持收敛。",
    "en_tdlr": "The partial sharing mechanism of the PSO-Fed algorithm not only reduces communication load and strengthens its resistance to model poisoning attacks, but also maintains convergence even in the presence of Byzantine clients."
