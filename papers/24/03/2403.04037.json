    "translated_abstract": "边缘智能和不断增长的物联网网络的结合开创了协作机器学习的新时代，联邦学习(FL)作为最突出的范式出现。随着人们对这些学习方案越来越感兴趣，研究人员开始解决它们最基本的一些限制。事实上，具有中心聚合器的传统FL存在单点故障和网络瓶颈。为了规避这个问题，提出了节点在点对点网络中协作的去中心化FL。尽管后者效率高，但在去中心化FL中，通信成本和数据异质性仍然是关键挑战。在这种背景下，我们提出了一种名为机会主义通信高效的去中心化联邦学习(OCD-FL)的新方案，其中包括系统化的FL对等选择以进行协作，旨在实现最大的FL知识增益同时减少能耗。",
