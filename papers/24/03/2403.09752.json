This innovative method revolutionizes healthcare by facilitating early disease detection and tailored care, particularly in chronic disease management, where IoMT automates treatments based on real-time health data collection. Nonetheless, its benefits are countered by significant security challenges that endanger the lives of its users due to the sensitivity and value of the processed data, thereby attracting malicious interests. Moreover, the utilization of wireless communication for data transmission exposes medical data to interception and tampering by cybercriminals.

    "translated_abstract": "互联网医疗物联网（IoMT）跨越了传统医疗边界，实现了从被动治疗向主动预防的过渡。这种创新方法通过实时健康数据收集实现早期疾病检测和个性化护理，特别在慢性病管理方面，IoMT可以自动化治疗。然而，由于处理数据的敏感性和价值，IoMT面临着严重的安全挑战，这会威胁到其用户的生命，因此吸引了恶意利益。此外，利用无线通信进行数据传输会使医疗数据暴露于被网络犯罪分子截获和篡改的风险之下。此外，由于人为错误、网络干扰或硬件故障，可能会出现异常。在这种背景下，基于机器学习（ML）的异常检测是一个有趣的解决方案，但它再次出现。",
