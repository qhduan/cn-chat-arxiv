However, global approximation methods are generally deemed inefficient. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric framework tailored for estimating treatment effects in RDDs. Our global approach conceptualizes the identification of treatment effects within RDDs as a partially linear modeling problem, with the linear component capturing the treatment effect. Furthermore, we utilize the P-spline method to approximate the nonparametric function and develop procedures for inferring treatment effects within this framework. We demonstrate through Monte Carlo simulations that the proposed method performs well across various scenarios. Furthermore, we illustrate using real-world datasets that our global approach may result in more reliable inference.",

    "translated_abstract": "在回归断点设计（RDDs）中，治疗效应通常使用局部回归方法进行估计。然而，全局近似方法通常被认为效率低下。本文提出了一个专门用于在RDDs中估计治疗效应的半参数框架。我们的全局方法将RDDs中的治疗效应识别概念化为部分线性建模问题，其中线性部分捕捉治疗效应。此外，我们利用P-样条方法来逼近非参数函数，并开发了推断在这个框架内的治疗效应的程序。我们通过蒙特卡洛模拟表明，所提出的方法在各种场景下表现良好。此外，我们通过真实数据集的例证，说明我们的全局方法可能导致更可靠的推断。",
