    "translated_abstract": "统计模型的两个概率分布之间的Fisher-Rao距离被定义为Fisher信息度量诱导的Riemannian测地距离。为了以闭合形式计算Fisher-Rao距离，我们需要（1）推导出Fisher-Rao测地线的公式，以及（2）沿着这些测地线积分Fisher长度元素。我们考虑了几种数值上稳健的Fisher-Rao距离的近似和界定技术：首先，我们基于子模型的闭合形式1D Fisher-Rao距离报告了Fisher-Rao距离的通用上界。其次，我们描述了几种通用的近似方案，取决于Fisher-Rao测地线或预测测地线是否能以闭合形式获得。特别地，我们获得了一种通用的方法，可以保证在提供Fisher-Rao预测测地线和严格的下界和上界时近似产生任意小的附加误差。",
