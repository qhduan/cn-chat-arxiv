    "translated_abstract": "多样化和复杂训练场景的自动化生成在许多复杂学习任务中是重要的。特别是在现实世界的应用领域，如自主驾驶，自动生成课程被认为对获得强健和通用策略至关重要。然而，在充满挑战的仿真环境中，为交通场景中的多个异构智能体进行设计通常被认为是一项繁琐且耗时的任务。在我们的工作中，我们引入了MATS-Gym，一个用于在高保真驾驶模拟器CARLA中训练智能体的多智能体交通场景框架。MATS-Gym是一个用于自主驾驶的多智能体训练框架，使用部分场景规范生成具有可变智能体数量的交通场景。这篇论文将各种现有的交通场景描述方法统一到一个单一的训练框架中，并演示了如何将其与其他自主驾驶算法集成。",
