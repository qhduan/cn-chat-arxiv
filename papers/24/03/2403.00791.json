However, training these models is challenging due to the scarcity of molecule-language pair datasets. At this point, datasets have been released which are 1) small and scraped from existing databases, 2) large but noisy and constructed by performing entity linking on the scientific literature, and 3) built by converting property prediction datasets to natural language using templates. In this document, we detail the $\\textit{L+M-24}$ dataset, which has been created for the Language + Molecules Workshop shared task at ACL 2024. In particular, $\\textit{L+M-24}$ is designed to focus on three key benefits of natural language in molecule design: compositionality, functionality, and abstraction.",

    "translated_abstract": "语言-分子模型已成为分子发现和理解的一个激动人心的方向。然而，由于分子-语言对数据集的稀缺性，训练这些模型具有挑战性。目前已发布的数据集有以下几种类型：1) 小规模且从现有数据库中抓取，2) 大规模但嘈杂且通过在科学文献上执行实体链接来构建，3) 通过将属性预测数据集转换为自然语言使用模板而构建。在本文档中，我们详细介绍了为ACL 2024年的语言+分子研讨会共享任务创建的$\\textit{L+M-24}$数据集。特别地，$\\textit{L+M-24}$旨在集中关注自然语言在分子设计中的三项关键优势：组合性、功能性和抽象性。",
