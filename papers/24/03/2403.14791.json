As a first step towards democratic governance and risk assessment of AI, we introduce Particip-AI, a framework to gather current and future AI use cases and their harms and benefits from non-expert public. Our framework allows us to study more nuanced and detailed public opinions on AI through collecting use cases, surfacing diverse harms through risk assessment under alternate scenarios (i.e., developing and not developing a use case), and illuminating tensions over AI development through making a concluding choice on its development.

    "translated_abstract": "通用人工智能，如ChatGPT，似乎降低了公众使用人工智能及利用其力量的门槛。然而，人工智能的治理和发展仍掌握在少数人手中，发展速度加快且缺乏风险评估。作为迈向人工智能民主治理和风险评估的第一步，我们介绍了Particip-AI，一个框架用于从非专业公众那里收集当前和将来的人工智能使用情况及其危害和益处。我们的框架允许通过收集使用情况更加细致和详细地研究公众对人工智能的意见，通过在备选方案下（即开发和不开发一种使用情况）进行风险评估呈现出多样化的危害，并通过做出对其发展的结论性选择阐明人工智能发展的紧张关系。为展示我们的框架对指导民主人工智能的承诺，我们收集了来自295个人口多样化的回应。",
