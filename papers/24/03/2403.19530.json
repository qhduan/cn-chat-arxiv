    "translated_abstract": "集成机器人在分布式账本技术（DLTs）中促进了效率和自动化。然而，它们的使用也与掠夺性交易和市场操纵相关，并可能对系统完整性构成威胁。因此，了解DLTs中机器人的部署程度至关重要；尽管如此，目前的检测系统主要基于规则，并且缺乏灵活性。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种利用机器学习检测以太坊平台上金融机器人的新方法。首先，我们系统化现有的科学文献并收集轶事证据，以建立金融机器人的分类法，包括7个类别和24个子类别。接下来，我们创建一个包含133个人类和137个机器人地址的地面实况数据集。第三，我们使用无监督和有监督的机器学习算法来检测部署在以太坊上的机器人。",
