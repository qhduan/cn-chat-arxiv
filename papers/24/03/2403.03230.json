    "translated_abstract": "科学发现常常取决于综合几十年的研究，这一任务可能超出人类信息处理能力。大型语言模型（LLMs）提供了一个解决方案。在广泛的科学文献上训练的LLMs可能能够整合嘈杂但相关的发现，以优于人类专家来预测新颖结果。为了评估这种可能性，我们创建了BrainBench，一个前瞻性的基准，用于预测神经科学结果。我们发现LLMs在预测实验结果方面超越了专家。在神经科学文献上调整的一个LLM，BrainGPT表现得更好。与人类专家一样，当LLMs对他们的预测有信心时，他们更有可能是正确的，这预示着未来人类和LLMs将合作进行发现。我们的方法并非特定于神经科学，并且可转移到其他知识密集型事业中。",
