Considering the principles respected in any society, TAI is often characterized by a few attributes, some of which have led to confusion in regulatory or engineering contexts. We argue against using terms such as Responsible or Ethical AI as substitutes for TAI. And to help clarify any confusion, we suggest leaving them behind. Given the subjectivity and complexity inherent in TAI, developing a universal framework is deemed infeasible. Instead, we advocate for approaches centered on addressing key attributes and properties such as fairness, bias, risk, security, explainability, and reliability. We examine the ongoing regulatory landscape, with a focus on initiatives in the EU, China, and the USA. We recognize that differences in AI regulations based on geopolitical and geographical reasons pose an additional challenge for multinational companies. ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文回顾了值得信赖的人工智能（TAI）及其各种定义。考虑到任何社会中尊重的原则，TAI通常被一些属性所特征，其中一些属性已导致监管或工程背景下的混淆。我们反对使用诸如“负责任的”或“道德的”人工智能等术语来替代TAI。为了帮助澄清任何混乱，我们建议将它们抛在脑后。鉴于TAI固有的主观性和复杂性，开发一个通用框架被认为是不可行的。相反，我们主张采取以公平性、偏见、风险、安全性、可解释性和可靠性等关键属性为中心的方法。我们审视了正在进行的监管环境，重点关注欧盟、中国和美国的倡议。我们认识到，基于地缘政治和地理原因而不同的人工智能监管对跨国公司构成额外挑战。",
