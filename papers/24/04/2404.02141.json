How do various drug combinations affect health outcomes, or how does technology adoption depend on incentives and demographics? Our goal is to partition this factorial space into ``pools'' of covariate combinations where the outcome differs across the pools (but not within a pool). Existing approaches (i) search for a single ``optimal'' partition under assumptions about the association between covariates or (ii) sample from the entire set of possible partitions. Both these approaches ignore the reality that, especially with correlation structure in covariates, many ways to partition the covariate space may be statistically indistinguishable, despite very different implications for policy or science. We develop an alternative perspective, called Rashomon Partition Set",

    "translated_abstract": "许多统计分析，无论是在观测数据还是随机对照试验中，都会问：感兴趣的结果如何随可观察协变量组合变化？不同的药物组合如何影响健康结果，科技采纳如何依赖激励和人口统计学？我们的目标是将这个因子空间划分成协变量组合的“池”，在这些池中结果会发生差异（但池内部不会发生），而现有方法要么寻找一个单一的“最优”分割，要么从可能分割的整个集合中抽样。这两种方法都忽视了这样一个事实：特别是在协变量之间存在相关结构的情况下，可能以许多种方式划分协变量空间，在统计上是无法区分的，尽管对政策或科学有着非常不同的影响。我们提出了一种名为拉细孟划分集的替代视角",
