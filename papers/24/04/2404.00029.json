Ideally, collaboration between humans and AI should lead to complementary team performance (CTP) -- a level of performance that neither of them can attain individually.

This work establishes a holistic theoretical foundation for understanding and developing human-AI complementarity. We conceptualize complementarity by introducing and formalizing the notion of complementarity potential and its realization. Moreover, we identify and outline sources that explain CTP.

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）可以提高各个应用领域中人类决策的能力。理想情况下，人类和AI之间的协作应该导致互补的团队绩效（CTP）--一种既不是他们个体所能达到的绩效水平。然而，迄今为止，很少观察到CTP，这表明对人工智能协作中的互补组分的理解不够，这些组分可以促进决策中的CTP。本研究为理解和发展人工智能互补性奠定了全面的理论基础。我们通过引入和形式化互补性潜力及其实现的概念，概念化互补性。此外，我们确定并概述了解释CTP的来源。我们通过在两项实证研究中应用我们的概念来说明我们的概念。在第一项研究中，我们关注信息不对称",
