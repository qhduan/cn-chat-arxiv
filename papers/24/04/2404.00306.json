Utilization of Recommender systems (RS) as a supply chain (SC) resilience measure is neglected although RS is a capable tool to enhance SC resilience from a reactive aspect. To address this problem, this research proposed a novel data-driven supply chain disruption response framework based on the intelligent recommender system techniques and validated the conceptual model through a practical use case. Results show that our framework can be implemented as an effective SC disruption mitigation measure in the very first response phrase and help SC participants get better reaction performance after the SC disruption.",

    "translated_abstract": "数字技术在提高供应链弹性方面的潜在用途越来越受到关注，尤其是在工业4.0和全球大流行病背景下。尽管推荐系统 (RS) 作为一种能够提升供应链弹性的工具被忽视，但从应变的角度来看，RS 是一种有效的工具。为了解决这一问题，本研究提出了一种基于智能推荐系统技术的全新数据驱动供应链紧急响应框架，并通过一个实际案例验证了概念模型。结果表明，我们的框架可以作为一种有效的供应链紧急响应措施在第一阶段得到实施，并帮助供应链参与者在供应链中断之后获得更好的反应表现。",
