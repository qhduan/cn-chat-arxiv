    "translated_abstract": "开放的大型语言模型（LLMs）显著推动了自然语言处理领域的发展，在各种任务中展现出卓越的性能。尽管LLMs取得了显著进展，但它们的有效操作仍然严重依赖于人类输入来准确引导对话流程，智能体调整是一种关键的优化技术，涉及人类对模型的调整，以更好地响应这种引导。针对这一依赖性，我们的工作引入了TinyAgent模型，该模型经过精心策划的高质量数据集训练。我们还提出了Collaborative Multi-Agent Tuning（CMAT）框架，这是一个创新性系统，旨在通过根据环境反馈进行自适应权重更新来增强语言智能体的能力。该框架促进了多个智能体之间的协作学习和实时适应，增强了它们的上下文感知和长期记忆。",
