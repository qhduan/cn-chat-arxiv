It begins with a general prompt or question about the task at hand and then gradually escalates the dialogue by referencing the model's replies, progressively leading to a successful jailbreak. We evaluate Crescendo on various public systems, including ChatGPT, Gemini Pr",

    "translated_title": "伟大，现在写一篇关于此的文章：Crescendo多回合LLM越狱攻击",
    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的流行程度大幅上升，并且越来越多地被应用于多个领域。这些LLMs在设计上避免涉及非法或不道德的话题，以避免对负责任的AI造成伤害。然而，最近出现了一系列攻击，被称为“越狱”，旨在突破这种对齐。直观地说，越狱攻击旨在缩小模型能做的与愿意做的之间的差距。本文介绍了一种名为Crescendo的新型越狱攻击。与现有的越狱方法不同，Crescendo是一种多回合越狱，以一种看似良性的方式与模型进行交互。它从有关手头任务的一般提示或问题开始，然后逐渐升级对话，引用模型的回复，逐渐导致成功越狱。我们在包括ChatGPT、Gemini Pr在内的各种公共系统上评估了Crescendo。",
