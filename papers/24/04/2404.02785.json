    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络(DNNs)已经彻底改变了人工智能，但是当面对分布之外(out-of-distribution, OOD)数据时往往表现不佳，这是因为在现实世界应用中由于领域转移不可避免，训练和测试数据被假定为共享相同分布的常见情况。尽管DNNs在大量数据和计算能力方面非常有效，但它们很难应对分布变化和有限标记数据，导致过拟合和跨不同任务和领域的泛化能力不佳。元学习提供了一种有前途的方法，通过采用能够在各种任务之间获取可转移知识的算法进行快速适应，从而消除了需要从头学习每个任务的必要性。本调查论文深入探讨了元学习领域，重点关注其对领域泛化的贡献。",
