More specifically, our goal is to enable a collaborative robot or industrial robot arm to perform food-slicing tasks by adapting to varying material properties using compliance control. Our approach involves using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train a robot to compliantly manipulate a knife, by reducing the contact forces exerted by the food items and by the cutting board.

    "translated_abstract": "厨房机器人可以通过减轻日常烦琐任务的负担，提高家庭体验。然而，在处理危险工具（如厨房刀具）时，这些机器人必须在共享人类环境中灵巧且安全地执行任务。本研究旨在使机器人能够自主且安全地学习食物切割任务。具体来说，我们的目标是通过适应性控制，使用协作机器人或工业机器人手臂执行食物切割任务，以适应不同材料属性。我们的方法包括使用强化学习（RL）训练机器人以合规方式操作刀具，减少食物和切菜板施加的接触力。然而，在现实世界中训练机器人可能效率低下、危险，并导致大量食物浪费。因此，我们提出了SliceIt!，这是一个用于在模拟环境中安全高效地学习机器人食物切割任务的框架。",
