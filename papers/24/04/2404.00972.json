    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.00972v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: An increasing number of brick-and-mortar retailers are expanding their channels to the online domain, transforming them into multi-channel retailers. This transition emphasizes the need for cross-channel recommender systems, aiming to enhance revenue across both offline and online channels. Given that each retail channel represents a separate domain with a unique context, this can be regarded as a cross-domain recommendation (CDR). However, the existing studies on CDR did not address the scenarios where both users and items partially overlap across multi-retail channels which we define as \"cross-channel retail recommendation (CCRR)\". This paper introduces our original work on CCRR using real-world datasets from a multi-channel retail store. Specifically, (1) we present significant challenges in integrating user preferences across both channels. (2) Accordingly, we propose a novel model for CCRR using a channel-wise attention mechanism to",

    "translated_abstract": "越来越多的传统零售商正在将业务拓展到在线领域，转变为多通道零售商。这种转变强调了跨通道推荐系统的需求，旨在增强线下和线上渠道的收入。本文介绍了我们在跨通道零售推荐中的原创工作，使用来自多通道零售商的真实数据集。具体而言，我们提出了整合用户偏好在两个通道之间的显著挑战。因此，我们提出了一种利用基于通道的注意机制的新颖模型，以解决这个挑战。",
