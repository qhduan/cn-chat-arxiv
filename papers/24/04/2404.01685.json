    "translated_abstract": "脉冲神经网络（SNNs）由于其稀疏的基于脉冲的操作而能为基于机器学习的应用提供超低功耗/能耗。目前，大多数SNN架构需要更大的模型大小才能实现更高的准确性，这对资源受限的嵌入式应用不太适合。因此，迫切需要开发能够以可接受的内存占用实现高准确性的SNNs。为此，我们提出了一种通过核大小缩放提高SNNs准确性的新方法学。其关键步骤包括调查不同核大小对准确性的影响，设计新的核大小集合，基于选定的核大小生成SNN架构，并分析SNN模型选择的准确性-内存折衷。实验结果表明，我们的方法学在准确性方面优于最先进的方法（对于CIFAR10有93.24%的准确度）",
