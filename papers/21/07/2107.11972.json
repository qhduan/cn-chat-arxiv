    "translated_abstract": "价格变动预测旨在根据当前市场情况和其他相关信息预测金融资产的未来趋势。最近，机器学习（ML）方法在学术界和工业界中越来越受欢迎，并取得了令人满意的结果。然而，由于金融数据的低信噪比和随机性极强，好的交易机会极为稀少。因此，如果不仔细选择潜在的盈利样本，这些ML方法容易捕捉到噪声而不是真实信号的模式。为解决这个问题，本研究提出了一种名为LARA的新型价格变动预测框架，包括两个主要部分：局部感知注意力（LA-Attention）和迭代细化标注（IRL）。LA-Attention旨在有选择地关注金融数据中最具信息量的局部区域，而IRL则旨在迭代地细化标注过程，过滤掉噪声和无关样本。在真实世界的金融数据集上的实验结果表明，LARA在准确性和盈利能力方面优于现有的最先进方法。",
