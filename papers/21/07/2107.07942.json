    "translated_abstract": "实证回归不连续（RD）研究通常使用协变量来增加其估计结果的精度。本文提出了一种新颖的估计器类，比目前实践中广泛使用的线性调整估计器更有效地利用这些协变量信息。我们的方法可以容纳可能大量的离散或连续协变量。它涉及使用适当修改了的结果变量运行标准RD分析，该变量的形式为原始结果与协变量函数的差异。我们表征了导致渐近方差最小的估计器的函数，并展示了如何通过现代机器学习、非参数回归或经典参数方法来估计它。由此产生的估计器易于实现，因为可以选择类似于传统RD分析的调整参数。广泛的模拟研究说明了我们的方法在有限样本中的性能，另外，一个案例研究突出了它的实证相关性。",
