    "abstract": "This paper analyzes difference-in-differences setups with a continuous treatment. We show that treatment effect on the treated-type parameters can be identified under a generalized parallel trends assumption that is similar to the binary treatment setup. However, interpreting differences in these parameters across different values of the treatment can be particularly challenging due to treatment effect heterogeneity. We discuss alternative, typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular linear two-way fixed-effect (TWFE) specifications can be hard to interpret, \\emph{even} when there are only two time periods. We introduce alternative estimation procedures that do not suffer from these TWFE drawbacks, and show in an application that they can lead to different conclusions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文分析了带有连续治疗的差异法设置。我们展示了在一种类似于二元治疗设置的广义平行趋势假设下，可以确定对待处理类型参数的治疗效应。然而，由于治疗效应异质性，解释不同治疗值下这些参数的差异可能特别具有挑战性。我们讨论了解决这些挑战的替代假设，通常是更强的假设。我们还提供了各种治疗效应分解结果，强调与流行的线性双向固定效应（TWFE）规格相关的参数可能很难解释，即使只有两个时间段。我们引入了不受TWFE缺点困扰的替代估计程序，并在一个应用中展示它们可能导致不同的结论。",
