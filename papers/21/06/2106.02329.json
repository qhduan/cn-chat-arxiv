    "translated_abstract": "现代时间序列数据经常展示复杂的非线性依赖关系以及不规则的切换机制行为。这些特征在建模、推理和对潜在随机现象提供深入理解方面都存在技术挑战。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了一种新的建模框架，即深度切换状态空间模型（DS^3M）。该框架旨在准确预测此类时间序列，同时熟练地识别动态中隐藏的不规则切换机制。这种识别不仅在经济上具有重要影响，还有助于更深入地理解潜在现象。在DS^3M中，该架构使用离散潜在变量来表示切换机制，使用连续潜在变量来考虑随机驱动因素。通过将循环神经网络（RNN）与非线性切换状态空间模型（SSSM）相结合，我们成功捕捉了非线性依赖关系和不规则切换机制。",
