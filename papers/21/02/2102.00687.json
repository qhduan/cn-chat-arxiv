    "translated_abstract": "本研究利用第二次世界大战期间男性损失导致性别比例前所未有的变化，来研究性别失衡对日本婚姻市场和生育结果的影响。利用新数字化的基于人口普查的历史统计数据，我们发现男性在婚姻市场和家庭内部的生育决策中比女性具有更强的议价地位。在相对男性稀缺的情况下，尤其是年轻人更有可能结婚和离婚，但是丧偶妇女重新婚姻的可能性比丧偶男性要低。我们还发现，女性在婚姻市场上的议价地位在1950年代可能并没有改善。在战后堕胎法律的制度变化下，相对男性稀缺的地区的婚内生育率和死胎率增加。我们关于非婚生子女的结果表明，在家庭内部议价的理论预测在经济体中是具有稳健性的。",

The results suggest that men had a stronger bargaining position in marriage and fertility decisions, and relative male scarcity led to changes in marriage rates, remarriage likelihood, and fertility patterns. These findings indicate the robustness of the theoretical prediction regarding intra-household bargaining."
