[^1]: 拍卖与代币：货币政策作为机制设计选择

    Auctions with Tokens: Monetary Policy as a Mechanism Design Choice. (arXiv:2301.13794v2 [econ.TH] UPDATED)

    本文研究了基于区块链代币的机制设计，通过研究重复的私有价值拍卖发现，拍卖与代币相比于美元和金融证券拍卖，具有提前积累收入、变动较小和更适用于严重契约摩擦的优点。

    

    本文研究了基于区块链代币的机制设计，即在机制内可以使用的代币同时也可以在机制外保存和交易。通过研究一个重复的私有价值拍卖，拍卖者接受自己创建和拥有的基于区块链的代币作为支付。研究发现，预期收入的折现价值与标准货币拍卖相同，但这些收入的积累较早且变动较小。最优的货币政策涉及到燃烧用于拍卖的代币，这是许多基于区块链的拍卖的共同特征。进一步引入不可契约的努力和收入侵占的可能性。通过将代币拍卖与可以发行金融证券的美元拍卖进行比较，发现在存在严重的契约摩擦时，代币拍卖更受青睐，而当契约摩擦较低时，则相反。

    I study mechanism design with blockchain-based tokens, that is, tokens that can be used within a mechanism but can also be saved and traded outside of the mechanism. I do so by considering a repeated, private-value auction, in which the auctioneer accepts payments in a blockchain-based token he creates and initially owns. I show that the present-discounted value of the expected revenues is the same as in a standard auction with dollars, but these revenues accrue earlier and are less variable. The optimal monetary policy involves the burning of tokens used in the auction, a common feature of many blockchain-based auctions. I then introduce non-contractible effort and the possibility of misappropriating revenues. I compare the auction with tokens to an auction with dollars in which the auctioneer can also issue financial securities. An auction with tokens is preferred when there are sufficiently severe contracting frictions, while the opposite is true when contracting frictions are low.
