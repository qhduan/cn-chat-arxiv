    本文研究了协作学习推荐系统针对一种新型隐私攻击——社区检测攻击（CDA）的韧性。

    

    协作学习推荐系统源于协作学习技术（如联邦学习和八卦学习）的成功。在这些系统中，用户参与推荐系统的训练同时在其设备上保留已消费项目的历史记录。虽然这些解决方案乍一看似乎有利于保护参与者的隐私，但最近的研究表明，协作学习可能容易受到各种隐私攻击的威胁。本文研究了协作学习推荐系统针对一种称为社区检测攻击（CDA）的新型隐私攻击的韧性。这种攻击使得对手能够基于一个选择的项目集（如识别对特定兴趣点感兴趣的用户）来识别社区成员。通过在三个真实推荐数据集上进行实验，使用两种最先进的推荐

    arXiv:2306.08929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Collaborative-learning-based recommender systems emerged following the success of collaborative learning techniques such as Federated Learning (FL) and Gossip Learning (GL). In these systems, users participate in the training of a recommender system while maintaining their history of consumed items on their devices. While these solutions seemed appealing for preserving the privacy of the participants at first glance, recent studies have revealed that collaborative learning can be vulnerable to various privacy attacks. In this paper, we study the resilience of collaborative learning-based recommender systems against a novel privacy attack called Community Detection Attack (CDA). This attack enables an adversary to identify community members based on a chosen set of items (eg., identifying users interested in specific points-of-interest). Through experiments on three real recommendation datasets using two state-of-the-art recomme
