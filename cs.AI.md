[^1]: DualView：双重视角下的数据归因

    DualView: Data Attribution from the Dual Perspective

    [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12118](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12118)

    提出了DualView，一种基于替代建模的后期数据归因方法，具有高效计算和优质评估结果。

    

    本文提出了DualView，这是一种基于替代建模的后期数据归因方法，展示了高计算效率和良好的评估结果。我们专注于神经网络，在与文献相关的适当定量评估策略下评估了我们提出的技术，比较了与相关主要本地数据归因方法的性能。

    arXiv:2402.12118v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Local data attribution (or influence estimation) techniques aim at estimating the impact that individual data points seen during training have on particular predictions of an already trained Machine Learning model during test time. Previous methods either do not perform well consistently across different evaluation criteria from literature, are characterized by a high computational demand, or suffer from both. In this work we present DualView, a novel method for post-hoc data attribution based on surrogate modelling, demonstrating both high computational efficiency, as well as good evaluation results. With a focus on neural networks, we evaluate our proposed technique using suitable quantitative evaluation strategies from the literature against related principal local data attribution methods. We find that DualView requires considerably lower computational resources than other methods, while demonstrating comparable performance to comp
    
[^2]: 基于新的骨密度定义和计算机断层扫描进行人骨密度随年龄变化的研究

    The changing rule of human bone density with aging based on a novel definition and mensuration of bone density with computed tomography. (arXiv:2308.02815v1 [physics.med-ph])

    本研究提出了一种新的骨密度定义和测量方法，利用计算机断层扫描图像中的骨像素分布来测量骨密度。研究发现，在成年期39岁到80岁之间，骨密度呈线性下降，女性下降速度大约是男性的1.6倍，与现有观点相矛盾。这对于了解人体衰老过程具有重要意义。

    

    随着人口老龄化，骨质疏松症和易碎性骨折已成为重要的公共卫生问题。然而，使用双能X射线吸收法测量骨密度在个性化风险评估方面受到各种因素的干扰。本研究提出了一种创新的统计模型，该模型利用细分的计算机断层扫描图像中的骨像素分布来测量骨密度。我们的研究结果表明，在39岁到80岁之间的成年期，骨密度呈线性下降，女性下降速度大约是男性的1.6倍。这与广泛接受的观点相矛盾，即骨密度在女性绝经期开始下降，在男性大约50岁时开始下降。年龄相关变化的线性性提供了对人体老化动态的进一步洞察。

    Osteoporosis and fragility fractures have emerged as major public health concerns in an aging population. However, measuring age-related changes in bone density using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry has limited personalized risk assessment due to susceptibility to interference from various factors. In this study, we propose an innovative statistical model of bone pixel distribution in fine-segmented computed tomography (CT) images, along with a novel approach to measuring bone density based on CT values of bone pixels. Our findings indicate that bone density exhibits a linear decline with age during adulthood between the ages of 39 and 80, with the rate of decline being approximately 1.6 times faster in women than in men. This contradicts the widely accepted notion that bone density starts declining in women at menopause and in men at around 50 years of age. The linearity of age-related changes provides further insights into the dynamics of the aging human body. Consequently, our find
