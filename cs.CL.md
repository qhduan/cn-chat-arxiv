    面向方面的情感分析（ABSA）是一个细粒度的语言学问题，涉及从给定文本中提取多方面的方面、意见和情感。本文提出了一种自适应掩码方法，根据上下文去除无关标记，以帮助ABSA的Aspect Term Extraction和Aspect Sentiment Classification子任务。

    arXiv:2402.13722v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained linguistics problem that entails the extraction of multifaceted aspects, opinions, and sentiments from the given text. Both standalone and compound ABSA tasks have been extensively used in the literature to examine the nuanced information present in online reviews and social media posts. Current ABSA methods often rely on static hyperparameters for attention-masking mechanisms, which can struggle with context adaptation and may overlook the unique relevance of words in varied situations. This leads to challenges in accurately analyzing complex sentences containing multiple aspects with differing sentiments. In this work, we present adaptive masking methods that remove irrelevant tokens based on context to assist in Aspect Term Extraction and Aspect Sentiment Classification subtasks of ABSA. We show with our experiments that the proposed methods outperform the baseline methods in te
